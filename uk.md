# United Kingdom

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of UK law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to UK.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

UK also has a unique legal system, with some legal responsibilities
locally in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, while others are held
by the UK Parliament.  An attempt to point out these differences, when
relevant is made below.  In addition, the Crown Dependencies and British
Overseas Territories will be discussed in other pages -- this page
covers England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland only.

## Summary

Trans people should use care traveling to the UK due to a [UK Supreme
Court decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042). This
decision defines sex as sex assigned at birth, and generally allows
discrimination against trans people in single-sex spaces (bathrooms,
prisons, searches by law enforcement/airport security, lesbian
gatherings, spas, locker rooms, etc). In some cases, trans people are
advised by the decision to use neither male or female facilities if they
do not conform to their sex assigned at birth. In addition, vigilante
enforcement beyond the law is possible, and thus not only trans people,
but cis people who do not unambiguously conform to gender stereotypes,
should use caution. Note that the decision does not recognize surgery as
a valid reason to use the appropriate facilities. (updated Apr. 17, 2025)

People visiting the UK with trans youth (under 18) likely should be
cautious with mention of medical transition to medical authorities, as
some have indicated some types of care provided by some providers may be
reportable to child protection agencies.

The UK has non-discrimination law that protects "gender reassignment"
(defined as proposing to undergo, undergoing or having undergone a
process to reassign your gender) in the Equality Act. So there are still
some protections against anti-trans discrimination, but not when it
comes to bathrooms, locker rooms, police/security searches, lesbian
gatherings, etc.  (updated Apr. 17, 2025).

UK bans some trans care, notably most use of puberty blockers for anyone
under the age of 18 when used for gender transition. This ban also
applies to out-of-country prescription. It may impact UK citizens
bringing puberty blockers into the country.

Of note, sexual activity, even consensual sexual activity, even including
activities such as kissing, may place trans people at risk if they cannot
prove they disclosed their sex assigned at birth to their partner(s).

## Non-discrimination Law

 * The 2010 Equality Act protects "gender reassignment" (including those
   who propose, are in the process of undergoing, or have undergone
   "gender reassignment").  Medical procedures are not necessary for a
   person to be covered under this provision. Note that due to the [UK
   Supreme Court
   decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042), this does
   change the legal sex a person is recognized for single-sex spaces.
   (updated Apr. 17, 2025)
 * The law assumes a binary "gender reassignment", and does not
   reference non-binary people.
 * While harassment and discrimination against trans people are
   generally prohibited under the law, exceptions exist for some transphobic
   speech in some situations and restricting nearly all single-sex activities
   and spaces in trans-exclusionary ways. (updated Apr. 17, 2025)
 * Vigilante enforcement of the Supreme Court decision can be expected.
   This may impact cis women in particular, if their gender expression
   does not conform to expected female stereotypes.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people cannot use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. In some cases,
   the [UK Supreme Court](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042)
   has indicated that trans people should use a gender neutral bathroom
   if they do not conform to gender stereotypes of their sex assigned at
   birth. However that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
   (updated Apr. 17, 2025)
 * Even before the law change, some organizations have enforced anti-trans bathroom
   policies against trans women (for example, in October, 2024,
   [Butlin's dragged 5 trans women and a bystander out of women's
   toilet's](https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/12/butlins-security-guards-suspended-trans-women-dragged-toilets-21783297/); Similar incidents have
   occurred in locker rooms). (updated Apr. 17, 2025)
 * Beyond bathrooms, gendered spaces, particularly for women, may be
   extremely transphobic and likely will prohibit trans people. For instance,
   women's political events or a lesbian gathering. (updated Apr. 17,
   2025)
 * Vigilante enforcement of the Supreme Court decision can be expected.
   This may impact cis women in particular, if their gender expression
   does not conform to expected female stereotypes. (updated Apr. 17,
   2025)

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * UK does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of UK will require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.
 * In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers in the UK,
   These scanners do not display private parts (just a stylized outline of a
   body with areas of concern highlighted by squares), but it does
   require the security staff to hit either a pink or blue button
   depending on their estimate of the traveler's body (hitting the wrong
   one can trigger an alarm in a sensitive area of the body). Travelers
   with prosthetic may trigger the alarm, as may be trans people that
   are read as a gender that doesn't match stereotypes about their body
   parts.
 * While some trans travelers have reported that pat downs, when needed
   to resolve metal detector or scanner alarms, have been conducted by
   security staff that does not match their identified gender. It is
   likely this will be the norm since the Supreme Court
   [decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042). (updated
   Apr. 17, 2025)

## Other International Travel

 * Train travel internationally may follow many of the rules indicated
   above for air travel.
 * Transit police indicated they will treat trans people according to
   their sex assigned at birth. (updated Apr. 17, 2025)

## Jails / Prisons

 * Due to the Supreme Court [decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042),
   it is expected that all trans people will be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth, a reversal from previous policy. (updated Apr. 17,
   2025)
 * The prison service does not recognize non-binary identity.
 * Trans prisoners have reported misgendering and lack of appropriate
   hygiene items when housed according to assignment at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Binary trans people can change their gender identification on passports and
driver's licenses after meeting certain requirements. It is unknown how
the Supreme Court
[decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042) will impact
this. (updated Apr. 17, 2025)

Additional requirements are required to have your identified gender listed on
birth, death, or marriage documents. Note that UK does not recognize
updated gender markers from most places which allow "self-ID" for the
purposes of birth, death, or marriage documents.

Non-binary gender is not recognized in the UK.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * A [UK
   law](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/868/pdfs/uksi_20240868_en.pdf)
   bans transition-related puberty blockers in most cases for people under 18.
   This may impact UK citizens bringing puberty blockers from overseas, even
   with a valid overseas prescription. Overseas prescribers will not be able
   to issue prescriptions to be filled in the UK.
 * Trans patients will be ineligible to be treated on single-sex wards
   that don't match their "biological sex" (AKA sex assigned at birth)
   if [proposed changes to the NHS constitution are
   approved](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-68923861). This is likely
   to take effect now after a Supreme Court
   [decision](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042). (updated
   Apr. 17, 2025)
 * NHS clinics typically refer trans-related medical patients to
   specialty units. These units can have extremely long wait times (many
   years).
 * Hormone therapy is generally not available to youth (under 18) at NHS-run
   clinics.
 * Private trans care is available in the UK, but this will generally
   exclude puberty blockers.
 * [NHS England
   guidance](https://www.wearequeeraf.com/nhs-england-tells-gps-to-refuse-blood-tests-to-some-trans-children-and-refer-parents-to-safeguarding/)
   may result in GPs refusing agreements with private providers to monitor
   blood work for children receiving gender affirming care from other
   providers, including those outside of England or the UK. Additionally,
   guidance is to, in some cases, refer some children suspected of using
   puberty blockers or hormones to safeguarding (essentially to investigate
   possibility of abuse). It is unknown how this might apply to visitors
   seeking medical care in the UK. This guidance also indicates that there will
   be guidance in the future (sometime between now and the end of 2026)
   relating to trans adults who are using "unregulated" medical services such
   as overseas providers, but this guidance does not exist today and adult care
   is, in theory, unaffected by this current guidance.
 * Youth trans care is highly contested in the UK and is an area that is
   seeing a shift away from affirming the gender of trans youth. While
   youth care is available, parents should be aware of this and ensure
   any health needs of their children can be met while visiting UK.
 * Some private internet websites that provide HRT are [blocked in the
   UK](https://www.404media.co/google-delists-sites-providing-diy-hormone-therapy-at-behest-of-uk-government/).
   The UK appears to be targeting some internet-providers. As of now,
   the blocking has only impacted sites that prescribe HRT without
   prescriptions, but some UK government officials have indicated a
   desire to prohibit online prescribing in the future (however, it
   remains legal as of May, 2024).
 * Travelers should ensure they follow [drug importation rules of the
   UK](https://www.gov.uk/take-medicine-in-or-out-uk).  Specifically,
   non-UK residents should bring a letter that includes your name, dates
   of travel, a list of medications, dosages of all medications, and the
   signature of the prescriber. Note that you cannot bring more than 3
   months of medication. Note that rules for UK residents differ and may
   be more strict.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * UK health providers may[report use of hormones or puberty blockers by
   minors](https://www.wearequeeraf.com/nhs-england-to-tell-transgender-children-to-medically-detransition-or-face-safeguarding-referrals/)
   to child protection agencies when these are prescribed from
   "overseas" or "unregulated" providers.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Sexual Activity

 * "Deception as to sex" is an offense in the UK, and the Crown
   Prosecution Service has
   [guidance](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/rape-and-sexual-offences-chapter-6-consent#a11)
   that makes sexual activity without disclosing birth sex illegal.
   Sexual activity is broadly defined and may include things not
   considered sex in other countries (such as, possibly, kissing).
   This guidance also applies to people with a Gender Recognition
   Certificate (GRC): sex without disclosing birth sex, even for a GRC
   and who has had bottom surgery may be prosecuted.
 * Trans people engaging in any sort of physical intimacy (including
   even some forms while clothed) should consider if they may want to
   ensure they have documentation of disclosing their birth sex, to
   prevent a possible prosecution by someone who later has regrets or
   wants revenge.
 * It is likely this places trans people participating in some forms of
   the underground sex economy at high risk of prosecution.

## Relevant Laws

   sex](https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042)

## General Safety

UK, like many countries, is diverse and different areas may be more or
less accepting of gender variation.  In some cases harassment or even
violent attack (typically unarmed or knife attacks) may occur.  Unlike the
US, gun crime is rare in the UK, which provides some safety compared to the
US. (updated Apr. 17, 2025)

Knife crime against trans people sometimes occurs in the UK. For
instance, three boys [stabbed a trans
woman](https://news.sky.com/story/three-boys-arrested-in-stockton-after-transgender-woman-attacked-13163073)
in Cleveland in July, 2024.

There is a high awareness of the existence of trans persons in UK, due
to extensive (often transphobic) media coverage. This may prime some
people to engage in transphobia towards trans people and those perceived
as trans (such as cis people who have non-stereotypical gender
expressions).  Some people express transphobic views very loudly, through
well-funded transphobic media organizations.
