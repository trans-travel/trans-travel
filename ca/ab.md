# Canada - Alberta

Alberta recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary trans people.
I.E. trans women are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary
people are recognized for some purposes. The
non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws for adults are positive and there is
some non-discrimination protection for trans people. However, beyond these
laws, the province has taken negative action against trans youth. As of
February 5, 2024, planned restrictions for trans youth would be the most
restrictive of any province in Canada.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Alberta non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Alberta.
 * Anti-trans/anti-gay protests frequently occur, from groups that
   connect drag and transgender identity with conspiracy theories.
   These protesting groups are connected to the far-right.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While trans prisoners can be housed federally in accommodations that
   match the person's gender identity, it is unknown whether or not the
   province of Alberta does the same.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.

However, proposed policy, targeted at children in school, have
asserted that parents must approve of name and pronoun changes, even
when used informally, signaling a view of children's rights as
subordinate to parental rights when these rights conflict.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * However, Alberta has indicated that in Fall of 2024,
   [provincial policy would outlaw some trans youth medical
   care](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/danielle-smith-1.7101595)
 * Medical care may be somewhat more difficult for travelers to access
   than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * If Alberta enacts [policy as
   proposed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/danielle-smith-1.7101595),
   some trans youth medical care would be banned. It is unknown what
   impact this may have on custody.

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Alberta Human Rights

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Active, organized anti-trans activity frequently occurs in Alberta, and
Alberta is on the forefront of anti-trans "culture wars" in Canada,
both through protests and through official government action.
While this has not progressed to the degree it has in some USA states,
travelers should be aware and monitor for changes.
