# Canada - Yukon

Yukon recognize the gender of binary and non-binary
trans people. I.E.  trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some (but not all) purposes. The
non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws are positive and there is
explicit non-discrimination protection for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are explicitly protected in Yukon
   non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Yukon.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * It is unknown how trans prisoners are housed in Yukon currently,
   although Yukon does have policies that, on paper, seem to indicate
   that trans prisoners can be placed in housing in line with their
   gender identity.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are only recognized for some purposes, and binary trans
people are generally recognized on the basis of their gender identity,
including the ability to update their documents.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Trans medical care for adults may be somewhat more difficult for travelers
   to access than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

   Act](https://laws.yukon.ca/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/2002/2002-0116/2002-0116.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Limited, but active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Yukon, although this
is less supported than in much of the USA and other parts of Canada. Much of
this anti-trans activity occurs as online "protest" with occasional [in-person
anti-trans
demonstrations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-protest-lgbtq-rights-1.6973340).
