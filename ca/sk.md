# Canada - Saskatchewan

Saskatchewan recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary
trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some purposes. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws
are positive and there is non-discrimination protection for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Saskatchewan non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Saskatchewan.
 * Anti-trans/anti-gay protests sometimes occur, from groups that
   connect drag and transgender identity with conspiracy theories.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While trans prisoners can be housed federally in accommodations that
   match the person's gender identity, it is unknown whether or not the
   province of Saskatchewan does the same, although there is some
   indication it may in some cases.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are partially recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents, albeit sometimes requiring medical
documentation.

However, parents must approve of name and pronoun changes, even
when used informally, signaling a view of children's rights as
subordinate to parental rights when these rights conflict.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Trans medical care for adults may be somewhat more difficult for travelers
   to access than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Saskatchewan, and
Saskatchewan is on the forefront of anti-trans "culture wars" in Canada,
both through protests and through official government action.
While this has not progressed to the degree it has in some USA states,
travelers should be aware and monitor for changes.
