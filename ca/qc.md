# Canada - Quebec

Quebec recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary
trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some purposes. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws
are positive and there is non-discrimination protection for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Quebec non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Quebec.
 * Anti-trans/anti-gay protests frequently occur, with some events, such
   as some drag storytime events, being [moved to secret locations for
   security](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drag-story-hour-secret-location-1.6799385).

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans prisoners can be housed in Quebec prisons on the basis of
   gender identity rather than sex assigned at birth.
 * In 2023, a trans man was acquitted due to [transphobic behavior](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/court-tosses-case-against-trans-man-after-inappropriate-and-humiliating-montreal-police-interrogation-1.6314556)
   on the part of Montreal police.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update some documents.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Trans medical care for adults may be somewhat more difficult for travelers
   to access than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Quebec Charter of Human Rights and
   Freedoms](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/C-12)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Quebec, although this
is less supported than in much of the USA. Much of this anti-trans
activity occurs as "protest" towards Pride events that include youth.

In addition, the government seems poised to limit rights of trans people
in the future. A committee created to "study" trans issues and provide
advice to the government [lacks any trans
members](https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2024/01/quebecs-comite-de-sages-criticized-for-having-no-trans-members/).
