# Canada - Northwest Territories

Northwest Territories recognize the gender of binary and non-binary
trans people. I.E.
trans women are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people
are recognized. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws are positive
and there is explicit non-discrimination protection for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are explicitly protected in Northwest Territories
   non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Northwest Territories.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * It is unknown how trans prisoners are housed in Northwest Territories
   currently.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Medical care may be somewhat more difficult for travelers to access
   than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Northwest Territories Human Rights
   Act](https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/files/legislation/human-rights/human-rights.a.pdf)

## General Safety

Active, organized anti-trans activity rarely occurs in Northwest Territories.

However, because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and
media space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
