# Canada - Manitoba

Manitoba recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary trans people.
I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some purposes. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws
are positive and there is non-discrimination protection for trans people.

In late 2023, Manitoba has taken official stances to re-affirm their
support for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Manitoba non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Manitoba.
 * Anti-trans/anti-gay protests sometimes occur, from groups that
   connect drag and transgender identity with conspiracy theories.
   In 2023, these protests were generally opposed by pro-trans
   counter-protesters that outnumbered the anti-trans protesters.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While trans prisoners can be housed federally in accommodations that
   match the person's gender identity, it is unknown whether or not the
   province of Manitoba does the same.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Trans medical care for adults may be somewhat more difficult for travelers
   to access than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Manitoba.  While this has
not progressed to the degree it has in some USA states, travelers should
be aware and monitor for changes.
