# Canada - Ontario

Ontario recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men. The
non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws are positive and there is
non-discrimination protection for trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Ontario non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Ontario.
 * [Anti-trans/anti-gay protests frequently
   occur](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/supporters-outnumber-protesters-at-drag-queen-storytime-in-woodstock-ont-1.6781291)
   at drag storytime events in Ontario.

## Air Travel

International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.

Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different genders screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans prisoners can be housed in Ontario prisons on the basis of
   gender identity rather than sex assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Medical care may be somewhat more difficult for travelers to access
   than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
   USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
   world may.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Ontario, although this
is less supported than in much of the USA. Much of this anti-trans
activity occurs as "protest" towards Pride events that include youth.

One local contributor noted that the Kitchener/Waterloo/Cambridge area, being
largely a university town, is a comparatively safe space, though there
will always be pockets of what I'll politely call radicalized members.
Of late there have been smaller hate groups mobilizing to attempt to get
their own onto school boards and municipal legislation for the obvious
reasons, but thus far (updated on Sept. 17, 2023) to no avail.
