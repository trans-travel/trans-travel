# Bermuda

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of BM law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to Bermuda.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

## Summary

While Bermuda does not recognize same-sex marriage and does not allow
gender reassignment, it does have some non-discrimination protections
for sexual orientation.

It does not have legal gender identity protections.

Bermuda does not appear to have law that makes it illegal for trans people
to use bathrooms, children to receive gender affirming medical care, or for
trans people to dress differently than your sex assigned at birth.
However, because no positive law exists, discrimination would be legal.

Note that resorts and tourist areas may be more accepting than other
areas, and that some openly LGBT people do travel to Bermuda and enjoy
their trips.

The age of consent also differs depending on type of sex act, with anal
sex requiring the person to be age 18 or older (vs. PIV sex, where age
of consent is 16). For people 18 or older, having sex with others 18 or
older, there are no legal concerns.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * There is no protections from discrimination on the basis of gender
   identity in law.
 * There is some protections for LGB travellers to Bermuda, particularly
   in public accommodations.
 * There is no recognition of same-sex marriage in Bermuda.

## Public Accommodations

 * There is no protections from discrimination on the basis of gender
   identity in law.
 * There is some protections for LGB travellers to Bermuda, particularly
   in public accommodations.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Bermuda does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.

## Importation Rules

 * People have been arrested for importing LGBT pornography in the past,
   although it appears that this is not currently against the law.
 * While prescription medication is typically allowed, non-prescribed
   medication may expose you to legal problems in Bermuda.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of Bermuda may require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.
 * In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers. It is
   unknown if these scanners have been programmed in a trans-affirming
   way.
 * It is unknown what policies Bermuda applies to pat-down searches.

## Other International Travel

 * It is unknown what security and identity restrictions may exist for
   ocean travel.
 * People have been arrested for importing LGBT pornography in the past,
   although it appears that this is not currently against the law.

## Jails / Prisons

 * It is unknown how Bermuda houses transgender prisoners, although it
   is likely according to either anatomy or assignment at birth. Most
   likely trans women would be housed in men's jails or prisons.
 * Trans affirming medical care is likely unavailable in jails/prisons.

## Legal Definition of Sex

There is no recognition of legal gender change, and non-binary gender is
not recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care appears legal for adults but providers may be
   difficult (or impossible) to locate.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * It is unknown whether or not Bermuda sees transition as child abuse.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage is not recognized.
 * Bermuda was the first country in the world to repeal a law that
   previously allowed gay marriage. This may indicate the general
   trajectory of the country regarding LGB rights.
 * It is likely that Bermuda would consider sex assigned at birth when
   determining if a marriage is an opposite-sex marriage.
 * Married couples may wish to ensure that their legal rights are
   protected through alternative means when traveling to Bermuda.
   Spouses may be treated as legal strangers and other relatives may
   have more rights for decision making in cases of injury or death.

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Many in Bermuda do not approve of LGBT people or relationships. Tourist
areas may be more accepting (some LGBT travelers report positive
experiences visiting the island).

Public signs of affection and non-binary presentation may be offensive
to some in Bermuda.
