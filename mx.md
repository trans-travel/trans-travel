# Mexico

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of Mexican law and culture, and who
does not speak Spanish put this page together. I would be very grateful
for those with more knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.
While this is geared for people who might travel to Mexico, I prefer
that it would written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

## Summary

While Mexico does not specifically name trans people in
non-discrimination law, they appear to be protected under the law by
CONAPRED, the group responsible for enforcing the national
anti-discrimination law.

Mexico does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * CONAPRED, the Mexican non-discrimination agency, does appear to
   consider anti-transgender discrimination to be a violation of Mexican
   anti-discrimination law, although the law does not specifically
   mention trans people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Mexico does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of Mexico will require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people have recently obtained legal recognition, although this
change is a work in progress and is at the early stages.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Medical tourism is a large industry in Mexico. Some clinics are
   reputable and operate with high standards within regulations, while
   others are operating outside of the law and may target medical
   tourists, providing unsafe care.
 * Care for transgender youth may be as easily available.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Mexico is a large country, with a variety of different cultures. Some of
these cultures have a long heritage of people who do not fit the gender
binary, but others are resistant to trans people. Trans people in
Mexico face discrimination and violence. Standard travel warnings from
various governments should also be followed when visiting any country,
including Mexico.
