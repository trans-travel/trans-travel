# Introduction

This project seeks to provide "travel advice" for trans travelers
(and our companions) based on laws and practical
safety within various jurisdictions.

If you are viewing this at
[https://TravelWhileTrans.com/](https://TravelWhileTrans.com/),
you can select a jurisdiction using the sidebar on the left. On mobile,
you can click the "three bars" on the top left of the page which will
pull out the sidebar (or turn your phone sideways).

It is not geared towards people already living in a jurisdiction.
For instance, laws about medical insurance won't
generally be mentioned, as most people traveling will have
out-of-jurisdiction medical insurance. Likewise, laws about school
athletics will not be mentioned as these generally don't impact
travelers.  However, information that might impact travelers in
different situation will be mentioned. For instance, someone assigned to
a business project for several months in a state may need to utilize
medical care. Others may travel with children and be concerned about how
this could be seen as child abuse or cause child custody issues.

# Other Formats

This is also available as a PDF. This may be particularly useful to
people needing to cite this information or who want to carry a copy with
them on their mobile device.  You can access the PDF version at

# Disclaimer

This is not legal advice, and is not put together by a lawyer.  This
information is not guaranteed to be up-to-date or accurate.  You
should consult with an attorney with any questions.

# Missing Jurisdictions

This guide is definitely incomplete, and contains only a handful of
jurisdictions at this time.  Contributions of additional jurisdictions
are always appreciated.

# A Note on Intersectional Oppression

This directory is focused on laws and safety concerns that generally
impact trans people. However, not all trans people have the same safety
concerns, which is why I've refrained from saying a state might be
"safe" or "dangerous" directly, or giving scores/grades/etc.  For
instance, a wealthy trans person may be able to more safely visit a
specific jurisdiction than someone without class privilege. Likewise, a
person with white privilege might be safe in a place where a person who
does not have that privilege might not.  The intent is to not erase
these legitimate intersectional concerns, but to be a starting point for
your research.

# About "Bad Countries" and "Bad States"

Trans people have always existed, and still do exist across all
cultures. A jurisdiction may be unsafe or have bad laws, but there will
still be trans people within that jurisdiction, and it's important to
consider them before fully writing off a state or country as not worth a
fight. In addition, there are accepting, open-minded allies in every
jurisdiction as well.

In addition, in both good and bad jurisdictions, there will be good and
bad treatment of trans people. The summaries in this project attempt to
summarize the situation for people, but they are just summaries. Any one
individual's situation may be different than what others face, both good
and bad.

# Errors / Omissions

This project welcomes contributions via pull requests or email to
Joelle Maslak <a href="mailto:jmaslak@antelope.net">jmaslak@antelope.net</a>.

The project is also available on Github as <a
href="https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel">https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel</a>

Particularly interesting is general information from people that know
the location, beyond just what the laws say. If you know a city has a
great neighborhood for trans people, or that there is a disparity
between how one area of the country or state treats people and another,
this is extremely valuable information!

This project also welcomes contributions of new jurisdictions!
To add a new jurisdiction, please utilize the template in template.md if
you can.
