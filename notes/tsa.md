# United States - Air Travel and Screening

Due to a January 20, 2025 [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/),
the policies below are likely to change within months of the order.
These changes may include trans people being screened according to sex
assigned at birth, including pat-downs by people who share the trans
person's sex assigned at birth.

The below mostly discusses the policies that exist as of now, prior to
implementation of the order.

When flying out of USA airports (including after connecting from
international flights), security screening is required.  This is done by
the TSA.

TSA recommends that tickets booked for travel out of USA airports be
booked with a gender marker that matches the gender on the person's ID
they are using for travel.  However, it is not technically required, and
not all airlines implement the "X" gender marker yet.  It is unknown if
or when the TSA may start denying travel for "X" gender marker holders.

Note if you are traveling internationally, you may be required to travel
with a ticket booked with the same gender as the passport you will be
using.

TSA utilizes body scanning technology for travelers not selected for
pre-check (see below).  When using this technology, at most airports,
the screener historically will hit a pink or blue button based on the
anatomy and/or gender they think the passenger has/is.  This may or may
not match gender expression.  This adjusts the machine to expect certain
anatomy.  If the pink button is pushed, a penis will likely alert the
TSA (it won't say what is wrong, but will place a colored box on a
cartoon figure of a passenger indicating what needs to be patted down by
the TSA).  If they hit a blue button, breasts will likely alert.

Transphobic agents may intentionally push the button most likely to
cause additional sensitive screening for the transgender individual.

Pat downs of these sensitive areas may be aggressive and triggering. You
have the right to ask for a private space and the screener of the
desired gender, although official policies may not always be followed.
In addition, these policies may change under the current administration.

Remain polite if being screened improperly, as actions construed by TSA
and law enforcement to be aggressive towards agents can be prosecuted.
Note that these agents and law enforcement include some transphobic
members, so it should be assumed that the most damaging interpretation
of behavior of the trans person will be the interpretation used. In
addition, TSA agents have some latitude in denying you the ability to
fly.

## Gender Mismatch with ID

In the USA airports, you should generally not have problems with a
gender expression that does not match your ID.  Note this does not
apply at international destinations.

This may change due to the executive order.

## Pre-Check

If you travel frequently and have the money to enroll, you can enroll in
the "Pre-Check" (or "Global Entry" which includes pre-check) program.
This increases your chance of being selected for pre-check screening. If
your boarding pass indicates "pre-check", you can use dedicated
pre-check lanes at most airports, and typically these will require a
metal detector but not body scanner, making travel possibly less
triggering. 

Note that Global Entry cards and other federal identification is subject
to the notes on the [USA General Information](notes/usa-general.md)
page. This may mean some travelers with "X" ID may experience problems.

Previously gender matches were not used to match a passenger ticket with
trusted traveler numbers (used to increase likelihood of being selected
for pre-check).  However, this may change, and it is best to ensure that
you use ID that matches your gender as indicated to your airline at
ticket purchase time and your membership in the travel program that
entitles you to pre-check.

## Note about International Travel

This only applies to travel from USA-airports.  If you fly
internationally, airports in other countries will have different
procedures. Pre-check is a USA program, and does not apply outside the
USA.

If you are entering the USA, consult the [USA international visitors](notes/usa-immigration.md) page.
