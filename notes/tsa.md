# United States - Air Travel and Screening

Due to a January 20, 2025 [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/),
the policies below are likely to change within months of the order.
These changes may include trans people being screened according to sex
assigned at birth, including pat-downs by people who share the trans
person's sex assigned at birth.

The below mostly discusses the policies that exist as of now, prior to
implementation of the order.

When flying out of USA airports (including after connecting from
international flights), security screening is required.  This is done by
the TSA.

The TSA no longer has information on their website for trans travellers.
While previous guidance is that the information you gave the airline
when booking travel does not need to match your identification, it is
unknown if that is actually true at this point, and it is highly
recommended you ensure your identification and booking information
match. If traveling to other countries from the USA, this is also
recommended as the other nation may validate gender matches between
ticketing information and identification.

Note that some airlines do not allow booking travel with an "X" gender
marker.

TSA utilizes body scanning technology for travelers not selected for
pre-check (see below).  When using this technology, at most airports,
the screener historically will hit a pink or blue button based on the
anatomy and/or gender they think the passenger has/is.  This may or may
not match gender expression.  This adjusts the machine to expect certain
anatomy.  If the pink button is pushed, a penis will likely alert the
TSA (it won't say what is wrong, but will place a colored box on a
cartoon figure of a passenger indicating what needs to be patted down by
the TSA).  If they hit a blue button, breasts will likely alert.

It is unknown how this will be done today, and trans travellers should
expect the possibility of TSA agents intentionally pressing a button
they think will cause the most invasive pat-downs to the passenger.

Pat downs of these sensitive areas may be aggressive and triggering. You
used to have the right to ask for a private space and the screener of the
desired gender, although these official policies were not always followed.
However under the current administration, it is unknown if the option to
ask for a screener of the desired gender is still an option. It should
be assumed that you may be patted down in the groin and breasts by
someone of your sex assigned at birth.

Remain polite if being screened improperly, as actions construed by TSA
and law enforcement to be aggressive towards agents can be prosecuted.
Note that these agents and law enforcement include some transphobic
members, so it should be assumed that the most damaging interpretation
of behavior of the trans person will be the interpretation used. In
addition, TSA agents have some latitude in denying you the ability to
fly. Prisons and jails in the USA typically jail people according to
sex assigned at birth, and rape/sexual assault is common in these
facilities, as is solitary confinement of trans folks. Thus trans
folks should consider avoiding this possibility if possible by
remaining polite, even when violated, to TSA agents.

Note that the federal government's policies on sex are solely based on
sex assigned at birth (and you should assume, regardless of your
documentation, that this will be determined on the whim of the
official). In addition, the federal definition of sex executive branch
agencies are using to operate does not consider your genitals, so
individuals who have had surgery should still expect to be screened,
patted down, etc, by individuals of their sex assigned at birth.

## Gender Mismatch with ID

In the USA airports, you should generally not have problems with a
gender expression that does not match your ID for non-federal purposes
(basically anything except gaining access to federal facilities,
such as passport clearance or courts).  Note this does not apply at
international destinations.

## Pre-Check

If you travel frequently and have the money to enroll, you can enroll in
the "Pre-Check" (or "Global Entry" which includes pre-check) program.
This increases your chance of being selected for pre-check screening. If
your boarding pass indicates "pre-check", you can use dedicated
pre-check lanes at most airports, and typically these will require a
metal detector but not body scanner, making travel possibly less
triggering. 

Note that Global Entry cards and other federal identification is subject
to the notes on the [USA General Information](notes/usa-general.md)
page. This may mean some travelers with "X" ID may experience problems.

In addition, newly issued pre-check and Global Entry cards will not
respect gender identity, but will be issued based on sex assigned at
birth.

Previously gender matches were not used to match a passenger ticket with
trusted traveler numbers (used to increase likelihood of being selected
for pre-check).  However, this may change, and it is best to ensure that
you use ID that matches your gender as indicated to your airline at
ticket purchase time and your membership in the travel program that
entitles you to pre-check.

## Note about International Travel

This only applies to travel from USA-airports.  If you fly
internationally, airports in other countries will have different
procedures. Pre-check is a USA program, and does not apply outside the
USA.

If you are entering the USA, consult the [USA international visitors](notes/usa-immigration.md) page.
