# United States - International Visitors

## General Information

This page contains information specific to international visitors to the
United States.  However, additional information that is relevant is
located in [General United States Information](notes/usa-general.md) and
in the state/territory specific pages on this site.

Note that the US has become officially transphobic due to an [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)
issued on January 20, 2025.

Crossing the border with documentation that matches US government
requirements can be stressful. However, trans people do routinely cross
the US border and many do not have any difficulty crossing the border
legally.  However, it is important that your documentation be in order
and all items you are carrying follow US regulations.

## Border Searches

Travelers legally crossing the border into the USA, regardless of citizenship
and documentation, are subject to search at the border.  This includes
examining electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones.

Prosthetics, post-surgical supplies, and LGBT literature are legal to be
brought into the USA.

When asked questions by officials, it is generally recommended to answer
honestly.  Lying to customs or immigration can be used to bar you from
entering the US.

## Medication and Supplies

The United States regulates many types of medications. In particular,
testosterone is a highly controlled substance.  Consult the US Customs
and Border Protection [Traveling with
Medication](https://helpspanish.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1444?language=en_US)
page for detailed information.  US officials recommend a written
prescription or doctor's note (written in English). Medication should be
contained in the original container, should not significantly exceed the amount that
you expect to use during your stay up to 90 days (if you are staying for a significant
amount of time, there may be additional limits and you will need to
obtain refills through a US doctor and pharmacy). The doctor's note
should note the condition being treated (being under the treatment of
a doctor for being transgender is an acceptable reason to have HRT).

It may be a good idea to ensure the name on all
prescriptions and medication bottles matches your name.

If in doubt, declare it.  Penalties for illegally importing medication
can be severe.  

Note that some states restrict access to medications, particularly for
youth.  Consult the state page for this guide for more information,
although most states do not prohibit the possession of legally
prescribed drugs.

Follow airline or other regulations regarding medical supplies for
equipment such as needles.

## Immigration Detention

Immigration detention facilities in the United States do not always
respect human rights.  Persons without documentation that is acceptable
to US Immigration may find themselves in ICE custody.

Immigration authorities in the United States utilize many types of
facilities for detention of immigrants. These range from outdoor holding
pens to county jails in cooperating counties to private facilities run
by for-profit corporations to government-run centers.  Conditions can
vary widely between these facilities.

While policies exist on transgender immigrants in ICE detention, these
policies are frequently ignored by staff.  They are also in the process
of being rescinded, due to the executive order mentioned above. Once the
executive order is implemented, trans women will always be housed with
men, trans men will always be housed with women, and non-binary people
will be housed in accordance with sex assigned at birth. Safety of trans
immigrants will not be a concern of the USA.

However, transgender immigrants may sometimes be held in units separate from
other immigrants.

Rape is common within ICE detention.

These facilities provide substandard care for transgender-related
healthcare and other conditions (such as HIV, cancer, etc).
