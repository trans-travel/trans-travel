# United States - General Information

## Bathrooms and Single-Sex Facilities

Federal facilities that segregate by gender (bathrooms, locker rooms,
prisons, etc) are in the process of being segregated according to
sex assigned at birth.  Trans women should expect to be required to use
men's bathrooms, trans men should expect to be required to use women's
bathrooms, and non-binary people should be expected to use bathrooms
according to sex assigned at birth. Intersex do not exist according to
these policies, so it is unknown how this will apply to them.

This only applies to federal facilities. Most spaces in the USA
are not federal facilities, but instead subject largely to state and
local laws.

Examples of spaces that are federally-controlled:

 - Bathrooms/toilets/showers in national parks
 - Federal prisons
 - Veterans Administration Hospitals
 - Immigrations and Customs Facilities
 - Military buildings
 - Federal buildings
 - Post offices

Notably, most airports, train stations, businesses, etc, are NOT
federally controlled and not subject to these in-process bans.

People who are gender-non-conforming should expect that their gender may
be questioned and their right to access a space may be questioned.  In
some cases, this can become violent, and these changes will embolden
people to attempt to enforce these actions themselves, even on spaces
where they do not apply.  Thus trans folk and people who do not match
the ideals of white femininity should in particular consider that
harassment may occur. Historically, butch lesbians and Black women
(including straight Black women) have faced disproportionate amounts of
questioning of their gender, in addition to trans folk.

## Lawlessness

The Trump administration has violated multiple federal court orders. In
particular, orders banning [deportation war powers under the Alien
Enemies
Act](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/16/g-s1-54154/alien-enemies-el-salvador-trump)
and orders [banning transfer of trans women to men's
prisons](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/transgender-women-prison-trump).

USA law that protects non-citizens and trans people can and will be
violated by the current USA administration.  Trans people and
non-USA citizens should use extreme caution in visiting the USA. In
March 2025, some permanent residents and visa holders were placed in
immigration prisons. It should be assumed that the Trump administration
will house immigration prisoners in line with assumed sex at birth.
(updated Mar. 16, 2025).

The check on this executive branch lawlessness in the USA is the US
legislative body.  It is unlikely the USA legislative body will choose
to impeach Trump for this lawlessness, as Democratic politicians largely
support "secure borders" and sometimes anti-trans policies. Beyond that,
the Republican party controls these bodies, and is unlikely to seek
impeachment of their party leader.

## Travel Warnings

The German Government has issued a [travel
warning](https://rp-online.de/politik/ausland/auswaertiges-amt-transmenschen-muessen-bei-usa-reise-aufpassen_aid-124615597)
for trans visitors from Germany. (updated Mar. 16, 2025)

InterPride has issued a
[warning](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/germany-interpride-issue-lgbtq-travel)
to USA-bound trans travelers. (updated Mar. 16, 2025)

Transgender Netwerk Nederland has also issued a
[warning](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/sb2.html) to trans
and non-binary travelers.

France has updated [advise for trans travelers to the
USA](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/03/25/france-updates-us-travel-advice-over-gender-at-birth_6739494_7.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email#)
(updated Mar. 26, 2025).

Both Denmark and Finland has issued a travel
[warning](https://apnews.com/article/denmark-us-transgender-travel-advisory-c0b533a72f2b22b438e6a4077889fefb?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
for travel by trans people to the USA (updated Mar. 26, 2025).


## US Passports

Currently (June 26, 2025), "X" markers are on US passports are still, in
theory, valid.  However, no new passports with an "X" marker will be
issued.  This is in spite a court order requiring the Dept. of State to
issue passports with an "X" marker.

In addition, no new passports will be issued with a gender marker change
(all are currently on hold).  It is unknown how previously-changed
markers will be handled at passport renewal time. This is in spite of a
court order requiring the Dept. of State to issue these passports
(update June 26, 2025).

## Other Federal Identification

It is likely that all requests for gender marker change on federal
documents will be denied. It is unknown if renewals would result in
reversal of previously-changed markers (except in the case of "X"
markers, which almost certainly will be reverted). In addition,
documentation may be held.

It is likely this applies to Global Entry and TSA Precheck.

## Presenting Identification for Federal Purposes

Travelers should use caution in presenting any documentation with an "X"
marker to federal officials. While there is no official policy currently
regarding how a federal official should respond to such documentation,
some officials may use this as an opportunity to enforce personal
transphobic beliefs.

Consider that the individual you are presenting your identification to
may be transphobic. In particular, if you have multiple forms of
identification available, consider what identification is or isn't
irreplaceable easily, should it become lost, destroyed, confiscated, or
held.

## RealID Implications

As of May 7, 2025, air travel will require RealID or other acceptable
identification. It is unknown if "X" markers will render identification
non-RealID compliant.

## Trans Medical Care

An Executive Order was issued that directs federal agencies to [restrict
gender affirming care for
youth](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/).
This could have wide-ranging implications, including for both adults
that are 18-years-old (considered children by this order) and for those
over 19-years-old, as it essentially directs a wide range of regulatory
agencies to issue restrictions on various medications.

While these restrictions still require rule making and agency directives,
and are currently [stayed by a
court](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf) (Feb. 13, 2025),
many hospitals complied in advance with this order
and canceled all trans youth medical appointments dealing with transition,
as well as halting prescription of medication.  Thus, availability of trans
youth medical care should be considered restricted within the USA.
However, some of these hospitals have begun providing care since the
initial order has faced court scrutiny.

## Future Outlook

The current national political leadership is known for
transphobic statements and rhetoric, and have indicated that they will
implement laws and regulations to make life more difficult for trans
people, including visitors.

An [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)
has been issued that intends to reverse all trans-inclusive USA
policies.

Those with future travel plans should be aware of the changing nature of
the national conversation. That said, as noted above, many of the laws
in the USA are local (I.E. most criminal laws are state laws, not
national laws), and regional information should be reviewed.  This
site has pages for all USA states and territories.

In addition, state governments have been tending towards worsening
restrictions for trans people. Visitors should be aware that this site
generally only notes legislation that is close to being imminently
signed.

Beyond this, some US corporations (Facebook, Amazon, and others) have
implemented changes, including ceasing funding for programs supporting
marginalized people (particularly people who are not white, are
immigrants, or are LGBT).  In some cases, these rollbacks include, as in
the case of Facebook, explicitly allowing harassment of LGBT people.
Conferences and events by large USA companies may be less welcoming than
in the past, and travelers should validate that policies important to
them (and may have been present at events in the past) will be present at
these events (I.E. policies that may have existed in the past but not now
for some USA corporations include availability of sanitation supplies in
non-women's bathrooms, non-gendered facilities, and ability to indicate
pronouns on conference badges and similar).  Note that some cities and
states in the USA do have positive laws that prevent harassment of LGBT
people, and some also require presence of non-gendered bathrooms.

## Air Travel

Transgender people are sometimes the victims of groping in airports or
on aircraft.

For air travel security, see the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Mass Transit

In November, 2024, violent, transphobic attacks at mass transit rail stations
have occurred.  These attacks have occurred in majority "Democrat" cities,
indicating that trans people may be at risk on these transit systems.
These attacks may be rising due to increasing anti-trans political
rhetoric.

Attacks in the past have occurred at stations or on trains in Boston, Denver,
Houston, Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco.  These attacks are
generally unprovoked and can be extremely violent.  In addition, it is
unusual for bystanders to intervene on behalf of a trans victim.

Some safety precautions you may consider:

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Minimize waiting time at train and bus stations.
 * When possible, travel with others.
 * In the case of a verbal threat or insult, consider whether it is
   possible to remove yourself from the situation (for instance, get off
   the train if it is possible to do so and stay separated from the
   potential threat).
 * When possible, de-escalate verbal threats and avoid verbal arguments. 
 * Inform others of your expected travel route.
 * Do not stand near the edge of a train platform or near the curb at a
   bus stop.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).
 * Arrange safer transportation if you will likely be under the influence
   of substances.

## Uber / Lyft

Some drivers are known to be transphobic, and you may encounter
hostility from your Uber or Lyft driver.  Some trans people have
reported being refused rides or being kicked out of the car in unsafe
locations.

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Utilize in-app safety features
   ([Uber](https://www.uber.com/gb/en/ride/safety/rider-safety-features/),
   [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/safety))
 * Both Lyft and Uber allow you to set preferences for quiet rides. This
   may reduce the chances of being "outed" for some trans people, and
   will reduce the chance of verbal arguments over politics, transgender
   human rights, and other contentious topics.
 * When possible, ride with others you know.
 * Ensure others know where you are and your expected route.
 * Use de-escalation techniques if the driver becomes verbally abusive.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).

## Immigration / Customs Enforcement

(Updated March 26, 2025)

The United States takes border control extremely seriously. Some
travelers have reported encountering transphobic border and/or customs
officials at USA borders.

Travelers using any documentation (passport, ESTA, visas, etc) that do
not reflect their sex assigned at birth are at particular risk and may
risk permanent bans on travel to the USA, along with the possibility of
detention.

See the [USA International Visitors page](notes/usa-immigration.md) for more
information, including information about drug importation.

Note that in the current political environment, transgender folks may
receive additional scrutiny.  It is also possible that should sensitive
searches (pat downs, strip searches, etc) be considered necessary by
agents, that agents may not follow procedures that are in theory still
in effect (current procedures would respect your gender identity, but,
again, these may or may not be followed currently).

The USA has also been targeting non-citizens with permanent residence
("green cards") and in some cases extraditing them to dangerous prisons
that resemble forced labor camps in third-party countries. In
particular, permanent residents who have criticized the government, have been
arrested and/or found guilty of a crime (even minor ones or crimes that
were dismissed), or have participated in protest activity or producing
works critical of the Israel government have been deported or detained
indefinitely. People without USA citizenship who live in the USA should consider
if they should leave the USA temporarily, as they may face scrutiny and be
denied entry, deported, or detained when they return the USA.

## Advocacy and Protests

(Updated March 26, 2025)

Care should also be used when interacting with public officials or
protesting government action. Government officials in the USA have taken
action against protesters for previously-legal activities.

For instance, in Washington DC, on December 10, 2024, A cis man was arrested
and charged with assault after a handshake with a Republican US
Representative where he asked the representative to support trans children.
The Republican Representative claims this was an attack, which is
disputed by witnesses ([See this story in The
Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5035804-nancy-mace-handshake-dispute-arrest/)).
It is likely under full Republican control of all branches of Federal
government that previously allowed protest and advocacy activities may
result in criminal charges and/or detention.

Beyond this, in March, 2025, non-citizens have been arrested by
immigration authorities for participating in anti-genocide protests,
which the USA considers antisemitic. Unlike widely recognized antisemitic activity
(for instance, Nazi salutes), the USA's policy is that protests or
academic/journalistic works that are critical of military action by Israel
against Palestinian civilians is antisemitic and evidence of support for
terrorism. This is used to detain or remove people from the USA, sometimes
using special powers granted to the Secretary of State, who personally has
authorized actions under Trump's orders. Some have been sent to work camps in
third-party countries.

The USA has also announced it plans to use terrorism laws against some
anti-Tesla protesters.

## General Safety

The USA has intense anti-trans rhetoric. While many travelers will not
encounter any violence and only encounter friendly people, particularly
in areas typically frequented by tourism, it is important to observe
situations, avoid escalation of verbal arguments, and avoid political
(or human rights) arguments.

Religious extremists operate within the United States. These
extremists, most commonly identifying with Christianity, feel empowered
by their God to persecute trans people. They feel that they are
dishonoring their God and disrespecting Godly truth if they do not
misgender and discriminate against transgender people. In some cases,
these people can be violent, particularly at Pride events. It is
safest to avoid interactions with street preachers and those carrying
religious symbols (such as large crosses) at Pride event. Some white
supremacist and neo-Nazi groups also participate in such events. In some
cases you may see overt Nazi and supremacist symbols. In many cases, Pride
events on public property have chosen to allow these people access to
events under threat of free speech lawsuits if they do not.  Note that
these people often attempt to provoke violence as part of a right wing
funding campaign (they will sue the attackers, event organizers, and city
for putting them at risk). Again the safest action is generally to avoid
interactions with these individuals, despite their intentionally
provoking language. Police often side with the right wing extremists
when violence occurs.

In addition, the federal government recently pardoned the January 6,
2021 insurrectionists. This includes known neo-Nazis, white
supremacists, and religious extremists.

The USA has recently taken action against long-standing civil rights
laws in the nation, including revoking a 1965 executive order banning
some government discrimination (including in areas such as race). The
executive branch is also attempting to redefine the 14th Amendment, a US
constitutional amendment that defines who is and isn't a citizen that
was enacted to ensure that former slaves became recognized as citizens
following the US civil war.

Crowds of drunk young men can become violent towards visibly trans
people. If you will be around groups which may include many drunk young
men, consider your safety situation.
