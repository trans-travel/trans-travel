# United States - General Information

## Future Outlook

The incoming (2025) national political leadership is known for
transphobic statements and rhetoric, and have indicated that they will
implement laws and regulations to make life more difficult for trans
people, including visitors. Future travel plans should be aware of the
changing nature of the national conversation. That said, as noted above,
many of the laws in the USA are local (I.E. most criminal laws are state
laws, not national laws), and regional information should be reviewed.
This site has pages for all USA states and territories.

In addition, state governments have been tending towards worsening
restrictions for trans people. Visitors should be aware that this site
generally only notes legislation that is close to being imminently
signed.

## Air Travel

Transgender people are sometimes the victims of groping in airports or
on aircraft.

For air travel security, see the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Mass Transit

In November, 2024, violent, transphobic attacks at mass transit rail stations
have occurred.  These attacks have occurred in majority "Democrat" cities,
indicating that trans people may be at risk on these transit systems.
These attacks may be rising due to increasing anti-trans political
rhetoric.

Attacks in the past have occurred at stations or on trains in Boston, Denver,
Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco.  These attacks are generally
unprovoked and can be extremely violent.  In addition, it is unusual for
bystanders to intervene on behalf of a trans victim.

Some safety precautions you may consider:

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Minimize waiting time at train and bus stations.
 * When possible, travel with others.
 * In the case of a verbal threat or insult, consider whether it is
   possible to remove yourself from the situation (for instance, get off
   the train if it is possible to do so and stay separated from the
   potential threat).
 * When possible, de-escalate verbal threats and avoid verbal arguments. 
 * Inform others of your expected travel route.
 * Do not stand near the edge of a train platform or near the curb at a
   bus stop.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).
 * Arrange safer transportation if you will likely be under the influence
   of substances.

## Uber / Lyft

Some drivers are known to be transphobic, and you may encounter
hostility from your Uber or Lyft driver.  Some trans people have
reported being refused rides or being kicked out of the car in unsafe
locations.

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Utilize in-app safety features
   ([Uber](https://www.uber.com/gb/en/ride/safety/rider-safety-features/),
   [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/safety))
 * Both Lyft and Uber allow you to set preferences for quiet rides. This
   may reduce the chances of being "outed" for some trans people, and
   will reduce the chance of verbal arguments over politics, transgender
   human rights, and other contentious topics.
 * When possible, ride with others you know.
 * Ensure others know where you are and your expected route.
 * Use de-escalation techniques if the driver becomes verbally abusive.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).

## Immigration / Customs Enforcement

The United States takes border control extremely seriously. Some
travelers have reported encountering transphobic border and/or customs
officials at USA borders.

See the [USA International Visitors page](notes/usa-immigration.md) for more
information, including information about drug importation..

## General Safety

The USA has intense anti-trans rhetoric. While many travelers will not
encounter any violence and only encounter friendly people, particularly
in areas typically frequented by tourism, it is important to observe
situations, avoid escalation of verbal arguments, and avoid political
(or human rights) arguments.

Crowds of drunk young men can become violent towards visibly trans
people. If you will be around groups which may include many drunk young
men, consider your safety situation.
