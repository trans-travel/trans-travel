# United States - General Information

## US Passports

As of today, "X" markers are on US passports are still respected by
officials.  However, no new passports with an "X" marker will be issued.
Instead, the passport application will be placed on hold.

In addition, no new passports will be issued with a gender marker change
(all are currently on hold).  It is unknown how previously-changed
markers will be handled at passport renewal time.

Note that because of these holds, any documents submitted to support
such applications (such as old passports, birth certificates, etc) will
be detained by the State Department until the hold is released and,
presumably, the application denied.

## Other Federal Identification

It is likely that all requests for gender marker change on federal
documents will be denied. It is unknown if renewals would result in
reversal of previously-changed markers (except in the case of "X"
markers, which almost certainly will be reverted). In addition,
documentation may be held.

## Presenting Identification for Federal Purposes

Travelers should use caution in presenting any documentation with an "X"
marker to federal officials. While there is no official policy currently
regarding how a federal official should respond to such documentation,
some officials may use this as an opportunity to enforce personal
transphobic beliefs.

Consider that the individual you are presenting your identification to
may be transphobic. In particular, if you have multiple forms of
identification available, consider what identification is or isn't
irreplaceable easily, should it become lost, destroyed, confiscated, or
held.

## RealID Implications

As of May 7, 2025, air travel will require RealID or other acceptable
identification. It is unknown if "X" markers will render identification
non-RealID compliant.

## Future Outlook

The current national political leadership is known for
transphobic statements and rhetoric, and have indicated that they will
implement laws and regulations to make life more difficult for trans
people, including visitors.

An [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)
has been issued that intends to reverse all trans-inclusive USA
policies.

Future travel plans should be aware of the changing nature of the
national conversation. That said, as noted above, many of the laws
in the USA are local (I.E. most criminal laws are state laws, not
national laws), and regional information should be reviewed.  This
site has pages for all USA states and territories.

In addition, state governments have been tending towards worsening
restrictions for trans people. Visitors should be aware that this site
generally only notes legislation that is close to being imminently
signed.

Beyond this, some US corporations (Facebook, Amazon, and others) have
implemented changes, including ceasing funding for programs supporting
marginalized people (particularly people who are not white, are
immigrants, or are LGBT).  In some cases, these rollbacks include, as in
the case of Facebook, explicitly allowing harassment of LGBT people.
Conferences and events by large USA companies may be less welcoming than
in the past, and travelers should validate that policies important to
them (and may have been present at events in the past) will be present at
these events (I.E. policies that may have existed in the past but not now
for some USA corporations include availability of sanitation supplies in
non-women's bathrooms, non-gendered facilities, and ability to indicate
pronouns on conference badges and similar).  Note that some cities and
states in the USA do have positive laws that prevent harassment of LGBT
people, and some also require presence of non-gendered bathrooms.

## Air Travel

Transgender people are sometimes the victims of groping in airports or
on aircraft.

For air travel security, see the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Mass Transit

In November, 2024, violent, transphobic attacks at mass transit rail stations
have occurred.  These attacks have occurred in majority "Democrat" cities,
indicating that trans people may be at risk on these transit systems.
These attacks may be rising due to increasing anti-trans political
rhetoric.

Attacks in the past have occurred at stations or on trains in Boston, Denver,
Houston, Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco.  These attacks are
generally unprovoked and can be extremely violent.  In addition, it is
unusual for bystanders to intervene on behalf of a trans victim.

Some safety precautions you may consider:

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Minimize waiting time at train and bus stations.
 * When possible, travel with others.
 * In the case of a verbal threat or insult, consider whether it is
   possible to remove yourself from the situation (for instance, get off
   the train if it is possible to do so and stay separated from the
   potential threat).
 * When possible, de-escalate verbal threats and avoid verbal arguments. 
 * Inform others of your expected travel route.
 * Do not stand near the edge of a train platform or near the curb at a
   bus stop.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).
 * Arrange safer transportation if you will likely be under the influence
   of substances.

## Uber / Lyft

Some drivers are known to be transphobic, and you may encounter
hostility from your Uber or Lyft driver.  Some trans people have
reported being refused rides or being kicked out of the car in unsafe
locations.

 * Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
   will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
   dangerous).
 * Utilize in-app safety features
   ([Uber](https://www.uber.com/gb/en/ride/safety/rider-safety-features/),
   [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/safety))
 * Both Lyft and Uber allow you to set preferences for quiet rides. This
   may reduce the chances of being "outed" for some trans people, and
   will reduce the chance of verbal arguments over politics, transgender
   human rights, and other contentious topics.
 * When possible, ride with others you know.
 * Ensure others know where you are and your expected route.
 * Use de-escalation techniques if the driver becomes verbally abusive.
 * Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
   on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
   phone to others).

## Immigration / Customs Enforcement

The United States takes border control extremely seriously. Some
travelers have reported encountering transphobic border and/or customs
officials at USA borders.

See the [USA International Visitors page](notes/usa-immigration.md) for more
information, including information about drug importation.

Note that in the current political environment, transgender folks may
receive additional scrutiny.  It is also possible that should sensitive
searches (pat downs, strip searches, etc) be considered necessary by
agents, that agents may not follow procedures that are in theory still
in effect (current procedures would respect your gender identity, but,
again, these may or may not be followed currently).

## Advocacy and Protests

Care should also be used when interacting with public officials or
protesting government action. Government officials in the USA have taken
action against protesters for previously-legal activities.

For instance, in Washington DC, on December 10, 2024, A cis man was arrested
and charged with assault after a handshake with a Republican US
Representative where he asked the representative to support trans children.
The Republican Representative claims this was an attack, which is
disputed by witnesses ([See this story in The
Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5035804-nancy-mace-handshake-dispute-arrest/)).
It is likely under full Republican control of all branches of Federal
government that previously allowed protest and advocacy activities may
result in criminal charges and/or detention.

## General Safety

The USA has intense anti-trans rhetoric. While many travelers will not
encounter any violence and only encounter friendly people, particularly
in areas typically frequented by tourism, it is important to observe
situations, avoid escalation of verbal arguments, and avoid political
(or human rights) arguments.

Religious extremists operate within the United States. These
extremists, most commonly identifying with Christianity, feel empowered
by their God to persecute trans people. They feel that they are
dishonoring their God and disrespecting Godly truth if they do not
misgender and discriminate against transgender people. In some cases,
these people can be violent, particularly at Pride events. It is
safest to avoid interactions with street preachers and those carrying
religious symbols (such as large crosses) at Pride event. Some white
supremacist and neo-Nazi groups also participate in such events. In some
cases you may see overt Nazi and supremacist symbols. In many cases, Pride
events on public property have chosen to allow these people access to
events under threat of free speech lawsuits if they do not.  Note that
these people often attempt to provoke violence as part of a right wing
funding campaign (they will sue the attackers, event organizers, and city
for putting them at risk). Again the safest action is generally to avoid
interactions with these individuals, despite their intentionally
provoking language. Police often side with the right wing extremists
when violence occurs.

The USA has recently taken action against long-standing civil rights
laws in the nation, including revoking a 1965 executive order banning
some government discrimination (including in areas such as race). The
executive branch is also attempting to redefine the 14th Amendment, a US
constitutional amendment that defines who is and isn't a citizen that
was enacted to ensure that former slaves became recognized as citizens
following the US civil war.

Crowds of drunk young men can become violent towards visibly trans
people. If you will be around groups which may include many drunk young
men, consider your safety situation.
