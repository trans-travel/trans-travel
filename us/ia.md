# United States - Iowa

Iowa has several negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans visitors.

Iowa does outlaw some medical trans care for children, but
does not generally criminalize such care, thus it appears that parents
visiting with trans children will not risk custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Iowa non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Use of single-occupancy bathrooms by students (as an exception) in
   schools requires parental permission in writing.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Iowa does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Medical care in state prisons is deficient for trans people

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws define gender based on "biological sex".

Non-binary people are not recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Most trans medical care is not legal for children. Banned treatments
   include puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries, although parents
   are not criminalized by this ban, with limited exceptions for
   some intersex people.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade six in schools.

Essex, a small town near Shanandooah, has [banned an LGBT
organization](https://www.kmaland.com/news/aclu-demands-shenandoah-prides-inclusion-in-essex-parade/article_8c16ccb0-4a64-11ee-85be-9b933dd52bdd.html)
from participating in a city parade, saying that the parade "will not be
used for and will not allow sexual identification or sexual orientation
agendas for, or against, to be promoted." This may indicate predominant
(or at least significant) attitudes towards LGBT people.

In 2023, Iowa City, University of Iowa police have [targeted transgender
protesters](https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2024/02/01/charges-against-seven-trans-protesters-spark-uproar-in-johnson-county-chloe-cole/72426978007/)
who protested against an anti-trans speaker, while not charging any
cisgender protesters.  This has drawn condemnation from the city's
board of supervisors and Human Rights Commissioner. Those engaging in
protests should be aware of this.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
