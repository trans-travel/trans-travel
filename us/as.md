# United States - American Samoa

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

American Samoa is not a "sanctuary territory", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.  It has a rich historical tradition of
Fa'afafine people, who sometimes are considered a third gender. However,
colonization has disrupted this historical tradition somewhat.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * American Samoa public non-discrimination laws do not include LGBT people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in American Samoa.
 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * American Samoa does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * American Samoa has unknown policies for trans people, so it should
   be assumed that trans people may be imprisoned based on sex assigned
   at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not legally recognized by American Samoa.

Binary trans people have some legal recognition of their gender.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * American Samoa does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
   transition-related medical care.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
   However, this only occurred recently (2022, with the Federal Respect
   for Marriage Act), and then only marriages from outside of the
   territory are recognized.  Notably, the territory has not implemented
   the Federal marriage equality decision.
 * It is unknown whether or not a trans person's gender would be
   recognized for a heterosexual marriage if the person applied for a
   marriage license in American Samoa.

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

American Samoa has few protections for trans people.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

American Samoa does have a history of being supportive of Fa'afafine
people, who are sometimes seen as a third gender.  After colonization,
laws were passed (and since repealed) that made some LGBT activities
illegal.  The indigenous history of acceptance still has strands that
survived colonization and people may find American Samoa somewhat
accepting, despite lack of public accommodations or other formal laws
protecting trans people.
