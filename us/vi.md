# United States - Virgin Islands

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

The US Virgin Islands do not have negative laws towards trans people.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * USVI bill 34-0271 passed in 2022 and provides non-discrimination
   protections to LGBT people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is protected for trans people in the US
   Virgin Islands.
 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * The US Virgin Islands does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized by US Virgin Islands.

There is provision for [legal gender
change](https://transitics.substack.com/p/the-us-virgin-islands-finally-legalises),
although there is a requirement for medical attestation. This is
implemented via executive order, after a bill doing the same failed to
pass.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * The US Virgin Islands does not have a sanctuary law for people
   obtaining transition-related medical care.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
