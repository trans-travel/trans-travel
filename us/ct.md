# United States - Connecticut

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Connecticut recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary. Connecticut has some of the
leading laws in the country and has demonstrated governmental will to
defend transgender youth.

Connecticut is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Connecticut non-discrimination laws.
 * Connecticut does have a religious freedom law that may provide
   religious exemptions to non-discrimination law in some limited
   circumstances.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Connecticut.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Jails and prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
   housing decisions for people who have ID reflecting their gender or
   who can demonstrate they would meet the standards needed to obtain
   ID with the proper gender marker.
 * CT law specifies that safety concerns should be taken into
   consideration, although that does not mean prisons will always address
   them in the proper way.
 * Transition care should be available in state prisons, but may not be the
   same standard as care outside of prison. At least one prisoner has
   [successfully sued](https://gaycitynews.com/trans-inmate-wins-connecticut-prison-officials-inadequate-care/)
   for negligent, illegal denial of care.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be in-complete in Connecticut.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Connecticut will not cooperate with other states who seek information
   about patients receiving care in Connecticut for medical transition.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Connecticut has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Connecticut 
 * Connecticut will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Connecticut will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Connecticut via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Public Act 11-55 - Non-discrimination](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/act/pa/2011PA-00055-R00HB-06599-PA.htm)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

However, much of Connecticut is considered reasonably safe.  That said,
attacks still can and do occur in Connecticut.  Some areas may be more
swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric. One suggestion from a CT
resident is to look up the voting districts you will visit to see their
party affiliation, which may correlate somewhat to LGBT acceptance/tolerance.

One community, Enfield, has [banned the Pride
flag](https://www.advocate.com/news/connecticut-pride-flag-ban-isis)
from being flown at government buildings. This was done at the first
city council meeting after it became a Republican-majority council.

People who live in Connecticut state that their government officials
actively support LGBT pride events publicly and pass good LGBT-related
legislation.
