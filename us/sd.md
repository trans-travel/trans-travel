# United States - South Dakota

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

South Dakota has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.

South Dakota does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).

## Non-discrimination Law

 * South Dakota non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * At least one  municipality (Brookings) has a local non-discrimination laws that
   applies to trans people, but because of a state law that provides
   wide-ranging exemptions on the basis of belief, this law is likely
   not applicable in practice.

## Public Accommodations

 * South Dakota has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in South Dakota

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically be housed with men (as of January 2023, no
   trans woman has ever been housed in a state facility for women).
 * Trans men are typically be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.

South Dakota allows gender marker changes on IDs only in limited
circumstances.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
   However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
   providers)
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   South Dakota due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
   puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * The Rosebud Indian Reservation would appear to recognize marriages of
   tribal members that occurred outside the reservation.

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 HB1080 - Trans Youth Medical Ban](https://legiscan.com/SD/text/HB1080/id/2695160)

## General Safety

South Dakota has established [a
hotline](https://news.sd.gov/news?id=news_kb_article_view&sys_id=1cf3adad1b43615062c8a8eae54bcba2)
for people to express "concerns" with aspects of higher education that
conservative politicians may disagree with. This will serve as a
chilling effect on free speech at colleges and universities in South
Dakota.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
