# United States - Kentucky

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Kentucky negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

Under a law that is currently (last checked Sept. 15, 2023) in effect (due to
actions of an appeals court in the Tennessee case) that criminalizes
hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgery,
Kentucky does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Kentucky non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
   Lexington-Fayette County and Louisville-Jefferson County.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Kentucky has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.
 * School employees will not be able to be disciplined for using
   pronouns and titles associated a trans student's sex assigned at birth.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Kentucky does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While Kentucky has a policy that they will not house trans prisoners
   in State prisons based on "genital status alone," genital status remains a
   consideration, as do many other factors (of which the trans person's
   gender is at best a minor concern).
 * The State does provide some trans medical care in prisons, although
   it appears this does not meet the current WPATH standard of care.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Kentucky due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
   people under 18 has passed and became law. It was initially blocked
   by court, but that block has been invalidated due to a decision by
   the US appeals court (last checked on September 15, 2023).
 * Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
   law applies only to medical providers.
 * Medical providers may be allowed to deny some care on the basis of
   their religious beliefs.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
   for children is illegal. This ban shows the state's view of this care. That said,
   puberty blockers and hormone therapy is currently allowed under a
   preliminary injunction as noted above.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

   Interpretations](https://education.ky.gov/districts/LegislativeGuidance/Documents/2023_Legislative_Guidance-Emergency_Bills.pdf)

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) in any grade, although the
legislative guidance by the Kentucky Department of Education is
that a district that does not teach sexuality or STDs to children before
grade six can teach about sexual orientation and gender identity, due to
a possible legislative error (using "or" when the legislature likely
meant "and").

Kentucky has a history of interpreting religious exemptions very widely
when discrimination occurs against LGBT people.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
