# United States - Guam

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Guam is not a "sanctuary territory", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Guam public non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
   generally (there are some exceptions in employment).

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Guam.
 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Guam does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Guam has some policies in line with the federal PREA, although it is
   unknown how these are implemented in practice (in many USA states,
   they are often implemented in ways that ensure trans people are
   inappropriately housed, so it should be assumed this could be the
   case in Guam as well).

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized by Guam.

Binary trans people are only fully recognized if they have had genital
gender affirming surgery.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Guam does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
   transition-related medical care.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Transgender Prisoner
   Policy](https://lgbtqbar.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/sites/8/2022/12/GENENRAL-ORDER-90.01-Prison-Rape-Elimination-Act-PREA.pdf)

## General Safety

Guam has few protections for trans people.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

Guam does have a history of being supportive of who today are called LGBT people,
pre-colonization. However, after colonization, laws were passed (and
since repealed) that made some LGBT activities illegal.  The indigenous
history of acceptance still has strands that survived colonization and
people may find Guam somewhat accepting, despite lack of public
accommodations or other formal laws protecting trans people.
