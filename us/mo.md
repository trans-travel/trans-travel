# United States - Missouri

Missouri negative laws towards trans people. These laws
are, while horrible for residents of Missouri, do not generally
apply to most trans people traveling to Missouri in most
situations.  Pending legislation that may or may not pass in 2024,
however, would legislate every aspect of trans life, including public
presentation, bathroom access, and non-discrimination law.  Thus, trans
travelers should be particularly careful making plans for travel in
2024 or beyond.

Transgender medical care for adults is legal (see notes below in medical
care section).

Missouri has a law against youth medical care. It is unknown how this
might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Missouri non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Missouri.
 * Missouri has a religious freedom laws that allow denial of some
   services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Missouri does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.
 * Transgender-related surgery in jails/prisons is banned.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

Missouri has a difficult process of changing gender on ID and birth
certificates, reflecting a state belief that sex assigned at birth
should typically reflect the gender of people. For ID, they must
demonstrate proof of bottom surgery or a court order (updated Aug 7,
2024).

Non-binary people are not legally recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.  There was a short-lived
   administrative ban order that was withdrawn on May 16, 2023.
 * Most trans medical care for youth is banned, including puberty
   blockers, hormones, and surgery, although some very limited exceptions
   are present for youth already undergoing care.
 * While continuation of some care is technically legal for trans youth, it
   is in practice completely unavailable. Multiple hospitals ([University of
   Missouri Hospital](https://www.wabi.tv/video/2023/08/29/father-transgender-teen-says-mo-hospital-will-no-longer-provide-gender-affirming-care/)
   [Washington University
   Hospital](https://source.wustl.edu/2023/09/statement-on-washington-university-transgender-center/),
   and St. Louis Children's Hospitals are three examples) have stopped
   providing trans-related healthcare for minors, even for existing patients
   who are "grandfathered" in the law. This is due to legal liability
   under the new "grandfather" clause, which uses a tactic similar to
   anti-abortion tactics of private action.
 * Continuation of trans youth care has been [targeted by several bills prefiled in
   the 2024
   session](https://documents.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills241/hlrbillspdf/3009H.01I.pdf).
   It is unknown if these bills will pass.
 * There is a [lawsuit against the
   state](https://www.aclu-mo.org/en/news/families-and-medical-providers-sue-missouri-block-transgender-youth-medical-care-ban)
   over SB49's prohibition of medical care for trans youth.
 * At least one pharmacy appears to have a pattern of [refusing to
   inclusively
   dispense](https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article280392949.html)
   to trans patients.
 * The Attorney General (Republican) has requested private medical
   information about at the Washington Univeristy Medical Clinic.  The
   hospital, as of December 6, 2023, is [contesting that
   request](https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/wash-u-alleges-missouri-ag-illegally-sought-patient-records-from-transgender-center/)
   under law. It is unknown what the outcome of that legal case will be
   and whether medical records will be turned over to political office
   holders.
 * In a separate case, a court has ordered Planned Parenthood of St.
   Louis to [turn over
   records](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/article_d65b6842-f8d0-11ee-9814-e7625b653629.html)
   to the Attorney General relating to trans patients at the clinic.
   While actual medical records protected by HIPAA are not included in
   the records that will be turned over, other potentially identifying
   records are.  Planned parenthood [has
   appealed](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/planned-parenthood-appeals-order-forcing-it-to-turn-over-certain-transgender-care-records/article_cc2c9f52-fe53-11ee-a2f1-0f625ca4c442.html)
   this.
 * The Attorney General is also ["investigating" social workers and
   therapists](https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/therapists-social-workers-face-scrutiny-in-missouri-ag-investigation-of-transgender-care/) which provide transgender care as of May, 2024.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care for children is banned.  This will applies to
   doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

In April 2023, a trans person was [attacked on a city
bus](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/hate-crime-1) in St. Louis
in what may be a random attack.  The individual who attacked this person
is still at large as of March 1, 2024.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

Kansas City's leaders have chosen to oppose the state's anti-trans
legislation and administrative orders through [a sanctuary
resolution](https://www.kcmo.gov/Home/Components/News/News/2040/1746)
that deprioritize cooperation with the state and enforcement of state
laws that criminalize and penalize trans people.  Likewise, St. Louis's
mayor has [issued an executive
order](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/documents/executive-orders/upload/Draft-EO-Trans-Rights.pdf)
to resist some state policies and show support for the trans community.
