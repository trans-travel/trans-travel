## General Safety

Pennsylvania is a diverse state, with areas of progressive politics
along with areas of regressive politics. Experiences in a city such as
Philadelphia may differ from experiences in more rural areas.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
