# United States - Massachusetts

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Massachusetts recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.

Massachusetts is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Massachusetts non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Massachusetts.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women may or may not be housed with women, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
   Genital state is considered highly relevant.
 * Trans men may or may not be housed with men, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
   Genital state is considered highly relevant.
 * Nonbinary people may or may not be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * City / County jails are not covered by the state policy.

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in Massachusetts.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change driver licenses, and
data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is still in-complete in
Massachusetts.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Massachusetts will not
   cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
   receiving care in Massachusetts for medical transition.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Massachusetts has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Massachusetts
 * Massachusetts will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Massachusetts will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Massachusetts via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

In Salam, on Sep. 12 or 13, 2023, a welcoming church and nearby rainbow
crosswalk was [vandalized with anti-LGBT
messages](https://www.salemnews.com/news/anti-lgbtq-hate-crime-targets-tabernacle-church-crosswalks/article_20603260-5246-11ee-961c-938a6325d7c1.html).
While this did not directly target LGBT people, it demonstrates hate
strong enough for someone to break the law and target organizations
based on support for LGBT individuals.
