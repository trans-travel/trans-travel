# United States - Delaware

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Delaware does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  However, Delaware
generally does not recognize 'X' gender markers.

Delaware does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Delaware non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Delaware does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women may or may not be housed with women
 * Trans men may or may not be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people may or may not be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * State prison policies state that genitals are not the sole
   determining factor, but also mention genital exams
 * City / County jails are not covered by the state policy.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Prison Policy 11-E-14](https://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/policies/policy_11-E-14.pdf)
 * [Prison Policy 8.60A](https://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/policies/policy_8-60A.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
