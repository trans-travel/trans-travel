# United States - Delaware

Delaware does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  However, Delaware
generally does not recognize 'X' gender markers.

Delaware does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Delaware non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
