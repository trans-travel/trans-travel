# United States - Texas

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Texas has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws could place trans visitors at risk.

It is important for parents of trans kids to research the current state
positions towards trans healthcare before a trans child visits Texas.
Texas does criminalize trans care for children through law, executive order
and legal opinion by the state's attorney general.
Elected officials in both the executive and legislative branch consider
transition of children to be child abuse. The state has shown willingness to
investigate families solely on the basis of a child's gender transition
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Texas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Cities are substantially banned from passing non-discrimination laws
   due to a new law passed in 2023.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Texas.
 * Texas has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * An Odessa, Texas, ordinance
   bans trans people from using any bathroom or changing room in the city
   other than one that matches their sex assigned at birth.
 * Some cities, such as [El
 Paso](https://www.ktsm.com/news/city-council-oks-2-resolutions-to-promote-transgender-rights/)
   are attempting to preserve trans rights to access city facilities.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Texas does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * A law that has vague language that attempted to ban "sexually oriented
   performances" where a child might be able to view it and could have been
   used against drag performers. This law was being [challenged in
   court](https://www.aclutx.org/en/cases/woodlands-pride-inc-et-al-v-angela-colmenero-et-al)
   and is [ruled
   unconstitutional](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300.94.0.pdf).
   Thus, drag remains legal in Texas.  However, a state university's
   drag ban was [allowed to
   stand by a local judge](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677.59.0.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
   as the judge saw no right to perform drag. So while people cannot
   prosecute drag performers or venues, at least some organizations will be
   able to declare that the first amendment does not include drag and thus 
   ban drag in their facilities.
 * Texas politicians, including the governor, in 2024 has repeated
   stated that transgender people should not have employment in jobs
   that involve interacting with children, unless they dress/present as
   their sex assigned at birth. This is not legally binding, but
   indicates government sentiment.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men.
 * Trans men are typically housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at birth.
 * Texas considers "genital status" a key factor in housing decisions.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Texas does not recognize non-binary gender.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

It is generally impossible to change your birth certificate or ID in
Texas (information accurate as of March 14, 2025).  The Texas Attorney
General has also indicated he believes any identification documents
changed in the past should be reverted to sex assigned at birth in an
[official interpretation of law sent to state
agencies](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2025/kp-0489.pdf)
(updated Mar. 14, 2025).

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Medical transition for people under age 18 is subject to child abuse
   investigations under executive orders, which are being challenged
   with some success. Under attorney general opinion, medical transition
   of youth is consider abuse.  However, these investigations are temporarily
   blocked by a temporary injunction.
 * Texas bans puberty blockers, HRT, and surgery for trans youth with few
   exceptions. This bill's enforcement actions are targeted primarily towards
   healthcare providers. (Updated Mar. 14, 2025)
 * Austin has passed a [sanctuary
   resolution](https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=427444)
   which limits city cooperation with state officials in enforcing
   gender affirming care restrictions. However, gender affirming care
   for minors remains illegal in all of Texas.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans youth medical care is illegal in Texas.
 * An executive order instructs child services agencies to investigate
   transgender children in many circumstances, placing custody at risk.
   However, these investigations are temporarily blocked by a temporary
   injunction.
 * The executive order and legal opinion of the AG is being challenged
   in court.
 * The anti-trans healthcare law penalizes healthcare providers, but not
   parents (but it co-exists with the executive order and legal opinion of
   the Attorney General).
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions.
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 * The current (2024) Attorney General of Texas requests lists of trans
   people from in- and out- of state hospitals, as well as
   [trans-/lgbt-related
   organizations](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/retaliation-texas-ag-paxton-demands).
   Persons with trans children should use caution when visiting Texas
   for any possible custody implications.

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * Note that the State's "Romeo and Juliet" law which provides exception
   to some statutory rape laws where a minor is involved (if the partner is
   within 3 years of age of the minor) does not apply to same-sex
   partners. It's unknown how Texas will determine gender, although in
   past cases regarding marriage, Texas jurisdictions have arrived at
   different conclusions for trans people.

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation
in schools.

Police in Texas may use excessive force in some cases against trans
folks. For instance, in March 2025, [police used excessive
force](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2025/03/18/apd-austin-police-department-trans-woman-video-slammed-to-ground/82518683007/)
in Austin to arrest a trans woman. Authorities claim that this was
within the use of force guidelines.  Ausitn police also recently raided an
LGBT nightclub (and later said they had the wrong address and meant to raid
a different nightclub).

The State has shown a willingness to investigate parents of transgender
kids, including subjecting them to different processes than are applied
for child abuse investigation (such as providing less of a paper trail).
People with transgender children should research the current status of
these laws in detail before traveling to Texas.

Cis women who do not look stereotypically female in a citizen's eyes
(regardless of actual appearance) have been [harassed](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/self-appointed-bathroom-cop-catches-dallas-woman-using-womens-restroom-8259104)
and [kicked out](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/pdio76/dragged_out_of_bathroom/)
of bathrooms by police or citizens.  In most cases, this is done with men
(police, citizens, etc) entering the women's bathroom, demanding ID, and
regardless of offered ID then kicking the woman out. In particular,
all women's bathroom users, trans or cis, who are sometimes read as men
(or do not present stereotypically femininely) should use caution.

Attacks against trans people occur in Texas.  For instance, a teen
riding a city bus on Houston was [robbed and
attacked](https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/transgender-teen-stabbed-houston-metro/285-9c3eaa18-4782-4a9e-a04a-4ca7e831afbe)
in December of 2024.

The current (2024) Attorney General of Texas requests lists of trans
people from in- and out- of state hospitals, as well as
[trans-/lgbt-related
organizations](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/retaliation-texas-ag-paxton-demands).
The Attorney General has made it clear that trans people are an official
problem in the eyes of the State of Texas.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
