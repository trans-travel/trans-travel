# United States - Ohio

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Ohio does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly,
although a trans woman was charged (and found not guilty) for changing
in a locker room.

HB68, as written, baned transition care for youth and goes beyond most other
bans of care including placing significant restrictions upon mental health
care, puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery. It also protects parents
harming youth through denial of trans-related care. On Mar. 18, 2025, a
state appeals court blocked the parts of this order relevant to puberty
blockers and hormone therapy. Other provisions, including mental health
screening requirements for youth, remain in effect.

In addition, Ohio also bans access to bathroom and locker room facilities
at all schools and universities (including university facilities such as
stadiums) except in accordance with sex assigned at birth. This would also
apply to private colleges.

In addition, an opinion from the Ohio Attorney General interprets
existing law to allow discrimination against trans people in bathrooms
and similar facilities, particularly if owned by government.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Ohio non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using most appropriate bathrooms and
   locker rooms, although at least one trans woman has been charged with
   indecent exposure for using a locker room (she was found not-guilty).
 * Ohio bans access to bathroom and locker room facilities at all
   schools and universities (including university facilities such as
   stadiums) except in accordance with sex assigned at birth.  This also
   applies to private universities.
 * The Attorney General has issued an
   [opinion](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/getattachment/f10767a2-2cf3-4844-b943-90a503dc4c52/2023-006.aspx)
   that requiring trans people to use bathrooms in line with sex
   assigned at birth, rather than gender identity, is not a violation of
   non-discrimination law and is legal in Ohio, particularly in
   government facilities.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Ohio, although some counties and municipalities
   do protect it.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Ohio does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * Neo-Nazis are attempting to [publicly intimidate
   attendees](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/state/2023/09/11/neo-nazi-blood-tribe-claims-it-has-launched-an-ohio-chapter/70602182007/)
   at some LGBT events in Ohio, notably around Columbus.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Several relatively recent (as of 2023) court cases have involved
   trans women who have been mistreated in jail and/or denied
   appropriate medical care.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some state administrative rules define sex on the basis of sex assigned at
birth.

Non-binary people are not recognized for most purposes, although they
can obtain birth certificates with an "X" marker (but not driver's
licenses or ID cards). Some county judges have denied birth certificate
changes to trans people, indicating bias within the Ohio legal system.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Ohio bans some transition care for youth and places significant
   stipulations upon mental health care and surgery. However, puberty
   blockers and HRT is legal, within the other confines of the law, as
   of an [state appeals court
   decision](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/state-district-court-of-appeals-blocks-ohios-ban-on-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-minors-in-an-historic-win-for-families-and-bodily-autonomy)
   on March 18, 2025. (see also [ACLU
   Ohio's lawsuit](https://www.acluohio.org/en/press-releases/aclu-ohio-preparing-lawsuit-challenging-hb-68)
   over the care ban)
 * Ohio has a religious exemption law that allows providers to deny some
   medical services.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Ohio due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (verified Mar. 18, 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse. However,
   as some youth gender transition medical care is illegal in Ohio, it is
   unknown how that may affect custody.
 * HB68 explicitly protects anti-trans parents who are causing harm to
   trans youth.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Ohio has active Neo-Nazi activity explicitly [targeting LGBT
events](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/state/2023/09/11/neo-nazi-blood-tribe-claims-it-has-launched-an-ohio-chapter/70602182007/),
particularly in the Columbus area.

Ohio and Ohio's political subdivisions have shown willingness to
extensively prosecute and litigate against trans people in court.

Currently pending legislative bills, that may or may not pass, are
particularly cruel towards the trans people they target (mostly youth,
but also college and university students and anyone visiting school or
university facilities).

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
