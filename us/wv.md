# United States - West Virginia

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

West Virginia negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people traveling to West Virginia in most situations.

West Virginia does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law does not have criminal penalties for parents and has exceptions for
"severe" gender dysphoria (which require specific processes to be
followed).  It is unknown how this might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * West Virginia non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * West Virginia has broad religious exemption laws that specifically
   allow for targeted discrimination against LGBT people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   West Virginia.
 * West Virginia has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Some cities/counties have non-discrimination laws, but the state's
   religious freedom laws would likely override these if the person
   discriminating was covered by them.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * West Virginia does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men
 * Trans men are typically housed with women
 * Nonbinary people are typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * The state has shown recent willingness to prohibit some trans medical
   care for inmates, including defending such choices in court.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

Non-binary people are not legally recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
   under 18 is illegal, unless the person has "severe" gender dysphoria,
   which requires a specific process to document the dysphoria and
   contains other limitations on the care available.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   West Virginia due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Most trans medical care is illegal for youth in West Virginia, although
   penalties will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 HB2007 - Trans Youth Medical Care Ban](https://legiscan.com/WV/text/HB2007/id/2748657)
 * [2024 HB4233 - Ban on Non-Binary Birth Certificates](https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb4233%20sub%20enr.htm&yr=2024&sesstype=RS&billtype=B&houseorig=H&i=4233)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

Rhetoric in Spring, 2024, is particularly strong around trans athletes
(following a court decision to allow trans youth to play sports) and the
[anti-trans West Virginia Governor's race
ads](https://wvpublic.org/w-va-gubernatorial-campaign-attack-ads-vilify-transgender-children/).
This rhetoric particularly targets trans youth, so caregivers should
exercise caution when traveling with visibly trans children to West
Virginia.
