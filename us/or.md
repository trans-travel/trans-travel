## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

There is a wide variety of politics in Oregon, including both
progressive and regressive politics. Hate groups operate in Oregon and
occasionally visit progressive cities such as Portland. Some of these
visits have resulted in violent clashes. Drag events and other LGBT
events have been protested by armed hate groups.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
