# USA - Minnesota

Minnesota recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people have some
government recognition.

Minnesota is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Minnesota non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Minnesota.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans prisoners have typically been housed based on sex assigned at
   birth, rather than gender, denied medical care, and mistreated by
   guards.

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in Minnesota.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change ID and birth certificates.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Minnesota will not
   cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
   receiving care in Minnesota for medical transition.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Minnesota has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Minnesota
 * Minnesota will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Minnesota will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Minnesota via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
