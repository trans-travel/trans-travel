# United States - Nevada

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Nevada does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people. While Nevada does not
have a sanctuary law, the state generally is proactive in legally
protecting trans people. Importantly, Nevada is the first state to add
protections for gender identity to their state constitution, which
included a component that required a vote in an election.

Nevada does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Nevada non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Nevada does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women may or may not be housed with women, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
 * Trans men may or may not be housed with men, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
 * Nonbinary people may or may not be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * SB153 requires the Dept. of Corrections to develop policies that
   provide proper medical care and housing, as well as training of
   staff, for trans inmates.
 * City / County jails are not covered by the state policy.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in Nevada, such as
state IDs and birth certificates.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * A provider associated with UNLV has received a forged letter
   attempting to [disrupt healthcare provided by the
   provider](https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/west/fake-anti-trans-letter-provokes-investigation-at-college-campus/),
   claiming to represent the views of the UNLV system..

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Nevada Constitution (see Art. 1, Sec.  24)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html)
 * [2023 SB153 - Prison Policies](https://legiscan.com/NV/text/SB153/id/2817395)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
