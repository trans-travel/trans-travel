# United States - Florida

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

HRC and Equality Florida, LGBT advocacy groups, have issued an advisory travel
warning for the State of Florida.  In addition, both LULAC and NAACP
have also issued advisories.  Finally, SPARTA, a transgender military
advocacy group has also issued a duty assignment warning for Florida.

Florida has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.

People visiting Florida, including connecting to outbound flights and/or
cruises, should be aware of the laws that may apply to them.

Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction, although it is not yet (or
proposed to be under pending legislation) legally considered child
abuse.  Florida's youth care ban also allows the Florida courts to have
emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it is necessary in an emergency
to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or is
threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or
procedures," similar to how the courts have jurisdiction over abuse.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
   include trans people.
 * Jacksonville's non-discrimination law is being [challenged by
   Alliance Defending Freedom](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/courts/2023/02/24/transgender-debate-sparks-catholic-store-lawsuit-over-jacksonville-hro/69933481007/) who seeks to allow businesses to
   require misgendering of customers, on the basis of religious
   owners of a for-profit corporation.
 * Public school (K12) employees are required to use pronouns and titles
   associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth. This is being
   [challenged in court by teachers impacted by this
   law](https://fox17.com/news/nation-world/florida-state-federal-lawsuits-mother-minors-transgender-hormone-therapy-puberty-blockers-treatment-lgbt-discrimination-lawyers-teachers-personal-pronoun-title-law-republican-legislature-gov-ron-desantis-social-conservatives-issues).
   One teacher has obtained a [preliminary
   injunction](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/florida-has-a-1st-amendment-problem)
   allowing her to use her pronouns in school, but this ruling only
   applies to this one teacher. Note that this preliminary injunction
   does not prevent students from misgendering her.
 * State officials have directed schools to [ignore Title IX
   regulations](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/04/25/four-states-to-ignore-new-title-ix-rules-protecting-trans-students/)
   (as of April 25, 2024) regarding non-discrimination against trans people.
 * Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
   might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
   possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
   these organizations. However (information current on October 11,
   2023), a court is preventing the state from enforcing the drag ban.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Florida.
 * There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
   bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
   not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
   to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
   covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies,
   schools, universities, etc.
 * The bathroom law will apply to airports and cruise ports, in addition
   to other government facilities. It also applies to highway rest
   areas, which are state owned.
 * Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Trans women are being challenged for using bathrooms not covered by
   the Florida law, including federal facilities [such as the
   VA](https://www.advocate.com/news/florida-veteran-transgender-bathroom),
   even before the Florida law goes into effect. The challenges are often
   other bathroom users objecting to the presence of trans women in the
   bathroom, after which business/organization staff, security, or police
   force the trans person to leave. This is regardless of the user's legal
   identification, length of time on HRT, etc.
 * Visitors to schools, such as parents and family members, will be
   covered by the educational laws and be required to be misgendered by
   school staff and forced to use improper bathrooms.
 * The bathroom law is [being challenged in
   court](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/09/29/transgender-nonbinary-group-sues-florida-in-federal-court-over-new-bathroom-restrictions/)
   as of September 30, 2023.
 * The Florida Dept. of Education has also [enacted
   rules](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20680/urlt/8-2.pdf)
   to ban trans people from bathrooms and locker rooms at private
   colleges and universities.
 * An RV park discriminated against a trans woman, telling her she
   needed to "dress like a man" and "act like a man" or face eviction.
   However, the federal HUD agency reached a settlement with the RV park
   requiring them to stop discriminating and pay the trans woman and her
   family a [$45,000
   settlement](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_22_160).

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
   drag performances where minors were present.
 * Florida has a "protection of children" law that bans "lewd conduct"
   and similar activities outside of venues such as strip clubs that are
   licensed for the purpose and only permit adults. This has been
   labeled a drag ban, and depending on how courts interpret various
   phrases may or may not actually be one. However, a court case, as of
   June 11, 2024, prevents the state from enforcing this law.
 * Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
   might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
   possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
   these organizations. However, see the above bullet point.

## Cruise / Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.
 
 * There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
   bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
   not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
   to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
   covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies, etc.
 * This law would apply to airport and cruise port bathrooms, so trans people
   and families should use caution connecting through Florida airports
   and cruise ports.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women must be housed with men.
 * Trans men must be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.
 * Local jails have housed at least one cis woman in men's jail after
   mistaking her for a trans woman.
 * As public funds cannot be used for transition care, trans prisoners
   will not have access to trans-related medical care.
 * Prisoners are subject to humiliating naked exams by people of the
   wrong gender and sometimes forced detransition (haircuts, prevention
   of use of gender-appropriate garments, etc.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in medicine were blocked in Florida
   due to the [Florida v. Health and Human
   Services](https://genderanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/047127228576.pdf)
   preliminary injunction on July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have
   many of the federal protections on the basis of sex when obtaining
   medical care in this state.

## Legal Definition of Sex

While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.  Florida does not permit trans people to
have driver's licenses that reflect an accurate gender marker.

Florida law defines sex largely consistent with sex assigned at birth
for a large number of interactions trans travelers may have. Birth
certificates, IDs, genital configurations, etc, will not take priority
over sex assigned at birth.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults, but with significant
   restrictions that are, in-practice, a ban on trans healthcare, and
   require misleading (and medically inaccurate) "informed consent"
   forms, restrict what providers can provide the care unnecessarily,
   and put in place restrictions that will prevent many providers who
   are otherwise qualified under the law from taking the legal risk of
   providing care.  Should any care providers continue to provide this
   care, there will be long waiting lists.  This is updated on August
   24, 2024.
 * Trans medical care for youth is illegal (as of August 26, 2024).
   This includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.
 * Medical providers can deny most care on the basis of their religious
   or ethical beliefs (emergency care is required to be provided).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * There is a law against trans surgical care for youth in Florida.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

HRC and Equity Florida have issued a joint
[travel warning](https://floridatraveladvisory.com/)
for the State of Florida due to anti-LGBT legislation.  The
[NAACP](https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida),
[LULAC](https://lulac.org/news/pr/LULACS_HISTORIC_WARNING_AGAINST_LATINOS_TRAVELING_TO_FLORIDA_IS_A_REMINDER_OF_ARIZONA_FOLLOWING_SB1070/)
(a Latino advocacy organization), the
[Florida Immigrant Commission](https://floridatraveladvisory.com/), and
[SPARTA](https://spartapride.org/duty-assignment-warning-issued-for-florida/)
(a transgender service member advocacy organization)
have also done so, for state-sponsored attacks against their
constituents' human rights.

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools.  Local officials have
broadly applied this law, including using the law as justification for
censoring [student speech](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/01/seminole-schools-offer-to-remove-lgbtq-pages-from-high-school-yearbook/?fbclid=IwAR0h7CGbTNdU8oXtyBdg872dGf0E9VcGFln6h2m8TafunxsZ_FJNaVKXpas).

Some state officials consider exposure of children to sexual orientation or
gender identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.

Florida has taken moves to [arrest peaceful
protesters](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/16/fdle-cracks-down-on-transgender-rights-protesters-2-months-after-panty-toss/)
months after protests against government officials. These protesters
were involved in LGBT, immigrant, civil rights, and reproductive justice
protests at government buildings. They did not damage property or use
violence. Those arrested included current and former government
officials.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

Recent attacks on trans girls/women have been reported in (note links
discuss violent crimes against trans people)
[bathrooms](https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/man-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-transgender-woman-in-miami-bar/),
[residential
areas](https://www.advocate.com/crime/2022/8/10/trans-teen-victim-vicious-anti-lgbtq-assault-second-time), [airports](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article290303974.html) (including misgendering by police of victim),
as well as by
[police officers](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jenny-deleon-florida-hillsborough-county-sheriff-choking_n_634ee621e4b0e376dc114d95).
In addition, at least one trans person has recently been
[wrongfully accused](https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/08/11/brevard-public-schools-dismiss-reports-transgender-school-assault/10297179002/)
of sexually assaulting others in bathrooms by Florida politicians.
Another trans person was [attacked while leaving a Miami LGBT
event](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/transgender-woman-severely-beaten-after-lgbtq-event-in-miami-18469390).

Fernandina Beach's city council, like other cities, passed a 2023
proclamation recognition Transgender Day of Remembrance.  However the
mayor and some city council members claimed the proclamation was
"political" and [refused to support
it](https://www.fbnewsleader.com/index.php/local-newsletter/mayor-steps-away-transgender-recognition).

That said, locals have indicated larger cities tend to be more inclusive
than rural areas, and southern Florida more inclusive than northern
Florida.  One city, Lake Worth Beach, has passed [a sanctuary
resolution](https://cbs12.com/news/local/lake-worth-beach-sanctuary-city-lgbtq-community-floridas-first-gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender-9-6-2023),
although that resolution will have limited power due to state law and
the ability and willingness of the state to remove local prosecutors who
do not enforce discriminatory state laws.
