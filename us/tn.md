# United States - Tennessee

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Tennessee has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.

Tennessee (as of July 1, 2023) bans trans care for children which has
an unknown impact on child custody, however parents are not penalized
under this law (it applies to healthcare providers), except possibly if
one parent provides hormones or puberty blockers without the other
parent's consent. While a preliminary injunction (as of July 8,
2023) would have allowed both puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth
until the case challenging the ban is heard, the appeals court decided
that stay was invalid. However, the plaintiffs in a related case in
Kentucky have asked that the entire appeals court re-hear the Kentucky
appeal, which could have impact in Tennessee.

In addition, Tennessee
criminalizes any adults (with exceptions for parents or people
parents have given permission to) providing information, aid, or other
help to get trans-related medical treatment, regardless of where the
treatment is given or whether or not the treatment is legal in the place
it is given.

Tennessee's Attorney General has requested private medical records
(and [received
them](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2023/06/20/vanderbilt-university-m-turns-over-transgender-patient-medical-records-to-tennessee-attorney-general/70338356007/))
to investigate at least one provider of transgender care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Tennessee non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people.
 * Tennessee municipalities are blocked from enacting laws that protect
   LGBT people.
 * Public school (K12) employees will not be able to be disciplined
   for using pronouns and titles associated a trans person's sex assigned
   at birth.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Tennessee.
 * Tennessee has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Tennessee bans trans people from school bathrooms and locker rooms
   that do not align with sex assigned at birth.
 * Tennessee previously had a bathroom ban that applied to private
   businesses, that required offensive signage if a business allowed
   trans people to enter the appropriate bathroom. However, that ban was
   found to violate the US Constitution's 1st Amendment and was struck
   down by a federal court.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Tennessee has a "drag ban" law that prohibits "male or female
   impersonators" who perform on public property, in any location
   where a minor could potentially be present. This includes felony
   penalties for a second conviction.  (Updated July 18, 2024)
 * Despite a previous ruling on that the drag ban is unconstitutional (since
   overturned), Blount
   County prosecutor (Ryan Desmond) is [attempting to enforce the
   law](https://www.lawdork.com/p/tennessee-prosecutor-threatens-pride)
   against a pride event.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.
 
## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are generally housed with men.
 * Trans men are generally housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Tennessee generally does not allow gender markers to be changed on IDs.
This is being [challenged in
court](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/transgender-tennessee-woman-sues-states-refusal-change-sex-109550308)
(updated April 25, 2024).

Tennessee does not recognize non-binary gender.

Tennessee specifically defines _male_, _female_, and similar words based on sex
assigned at birth and/or chromosomes.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Medical transition for people under age 18 is illegal as of
   July 1, 2023. This includes both care provided from within Tennessee
   and care provided via telehealth.  While a preliminary injunction (as
   of July 8, 2023) would have allowed both puberty blockers and hormone
   therapy for trans youth until the case challenging the ban is heard, the
   appeals court decided that [stay was
   invalid](https://storage.courtlistener.com/pdf/2023/07/08/l._w._v._jonathan_skrmetti.pdf).
   However, the plaintiffs in a related case in Kentucky have asked that the
   entire appeals court re-hear the Kentucky appeal, which could have impact
   in Tennessee.
 * There are some very limited exceptions to the care ban for youth
   continuing the same care who had received that care prior to the
   ban up until March 31, 2024.
 * Medical providers (including mental health providers) can deny some
   care on the basis of their religious or ethical beliefs.
 * Some Medical records of patients receiving care at Vanderbilt, including
   private and extremely sensitive information, have been
   [given to the state Attorney General](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2023/06/20/vanderbilt-university-m-turns-over-transgender-patient-medical-records-to-tennessee-attorney-general/70338356007/)
   to investigate trans healthcare provisions.  Vanderbilt patients [are suing
   the medical
   center](https://www.wsmv.com/2023/07/25/patients-sue-vumc-releasing-records-related-ags-transgender-clinic-probe/)
   for disclosing their private information. It is unknown if similar
   records requests and disclosures have been done at other organizations.
 * In addition, Tennessee criminalizes any adults (with exceptions for
   parents or people parents have given permission to) providing information,
   aid, or other help to get trans-related medical treatment, regardless of
   where the treatment is given or whether or not the treatment is legal in
   the place it is given.  See [SB2782 with
   amendments](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2782&ga=113)
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Tennessee due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for most youth in Tennessee.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized
 * However, officials can refuse to participate (I.E. issue a marriage
   license) in gay, interracial, interfaith, or any other marriage, so
   people who may have a marriage some may not approve of may want to
   reconsider being married in Tennessee.

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools without explicit
"opt-in" by parents.

Knoxville's Pride Center has been targeted by a hate group which [hung a
threatening banner on the
building](https://www.wbir.com/article/news/crime/hate-message-found-at-knox-pride-on-trans-awareness-week/51-d624fe11-3507-4813-bbf5-892f7a2e36f9).

Blount County may be particularly risky, as of August 31, 2023, as the
local prosecutor in the county has shown [willingness to enforce the drag
ban](https://www.lawdork.com/p/tennessee-prosecutor-threatens-pride)
against a pride event despite the law being ruled unconstitutional at
the time (the law is again in-force as of July 18, 2024).

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
