# United States - South Carolina

South Carolina does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly.

South Carolina does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * South Carolina non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically
 * State officials have directed schools to [ignore Title IX
   regulations](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/04/25/four-states-to-ignore-new-title-ix-rules-protecting-trans-students/)
   (as of April 25, 2024) regarding non-discrimination against trans people.
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity, particularly Charleston and Columbia.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in South Carolina.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * South Carolina does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men, although at least one
   trans woman has been moved to a woman's facility after the threat of
   a lawsuit.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Trans people have sued South Carolina over the denial of medical
   care for trans prisoners.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * However some providers, particularly Medical University of South
   Carolina (MUSC) have [cut off care for trans youth without
   notice](https://www.propublica.org/article/musc-medical-university-south-carolina-trans-healthcare-emails).
 * Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
   under 18 is illegal (updated May 21, 2024).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in South Carolina, although
   penalties apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized
 * South Carolina's domestic violence statutes only apply to straight
   unmarried couples, not gay unmarried couples. However, a court has
   declared that this is unconstitutional and it cannot be enforced in
   a discriminatory way.  Attempts to amend the law have failed.

## Relevant Laws

 * [Trans youth healthcare ban](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/4624.htm)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
