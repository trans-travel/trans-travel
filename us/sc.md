   for trans people in South Carolina.

   trans woman has been moved to a woman's facility after the threat of
   a lawsuit.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women

   jurisdictions

   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

   unmarried couples, not gay unmarried couples. However, a court has
   declared that this is unconstitutional and it cannot be enforced in

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
