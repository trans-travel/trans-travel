# United States - Montana

Montana has several negative laws towards trans people.

Montana does not ban trans care for children (due to a court judgment
that invalidated a healthcare ban).

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Montana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity, including Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Missoula, and Whitefish.

## Public Accommodations

 * Montana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.
 * School students will not be able to be disciplined for using
   pronouns associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth or their
   legal name..

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag storytime or other "learning activities" with children present
   in schools, libraries is banned, but this law is currently
   unenforceable due to a [temporary restraining
   order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mtd.73809/gov.uscourts.mtd.73809.13.0.pdf)
 * At least one library (Butte) has [canceled a talk on two-spirit
   identity](https://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-silver-bow-county-halts-transgender-woman-s-library-lecture/article_9771f330-00d3-11ee-9c16-6fa909f26697.html)
   to be given by a trans woman, citing the anti-drag law as the reason.
 * The Montana drag ban is being
   [challenged in court](https://billingsgazette.com/montana-drag-reading-ban-lawsuit/article_bbbc9f32-f278-5957-9f09-504fdbe02450.html).

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Montana passed a law that defined sex largely in line with sex assigned
at birth, which impacted nearly all Montana law (for example, Montana's
on-the-books-but-not-enforceable-due-to-SCOTUS anti-gay marriage law was
amended, as well as nearly every other law in Montana that references
sex).  However, the law was ruled invalid [due to an ambiguous
title](https://dailymontanan.com/2024/06/25/montana-law-defining-sex-as-male-or-female-unconstitutional-judge-says/)
by a state court.  Thus it is not in effect.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Montana does not generally allow changing of ID or birth certificate.
They have previously violated court orders on birth certificate changes.
The state is currently (as of April 18, 2024) [being
sued](https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4603075-montana-sued-over-refusal-to-amend-transgender-peoples-identity-documents/)
for the ban on changing birth certificates and ID.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * While a law was passed to ban trans healthcare for youth, that law
   was [ruled
   unconstitutional](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/landmark-ruling-montana-judge-blocks)
   under the state constitution and is thus unenforceable.
 * Medical providers can deny non-emergency care on the basis of their
   religious beliefs or conscious.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

White supremacists and anti-trans hate groups have been known to show up
at LGBT events in Montana. For instance, on May 20, 2023, a white
supremacist transphobic hate group [attacked attendees](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/05/21/bozeman-pride-marred-by-white-supremacy-anti-lgbtq-groups/)
at Bozeman Pride.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
