# United States - Rhode Island

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Rhode Island recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.

Rhode Island is a "sanctuary state", which protects trans care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Rhode Island non-discrimination laws.
 * Rhode Island does have a religious freedom law that may provide
   religious exemptions to non-discrimination law in some limited
   circumstances.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Rhode Island.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Jails and prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
   housing decisions, but state prisons note that prisoners will
   initially be housed based on sex assigned at birth.
 * Transition care should be available in state prisons, but may not be the
   same standard as care outside of prison.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be in-complete in Rhode Island.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Rhode Island  has a sanctuary law.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

   Law](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText24/HouseText24/H7577.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
