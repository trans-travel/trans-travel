# United States - Vermont

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Vermont recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary. Vermont has some of the
leading laws in the country and has demonstrated governmental will to
defend transgender youth.

Vermont is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Vermont non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
 * Public accommodations/businesses with single-occupancy bathrooms are
   required to sign these for all gender and allow access to all
   genders.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Vermont.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Jails and prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
   housing decisions, although most trans prisoners are currently housed
   according to sex assigned at birth.
 * Transition care should be available in state prisons, but may not be the
   same standard as care outside of prison.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be in-complete in Vermont.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Vermont will not cooperate with other states who seek information
   about patients receiving care in Vermont for medical transition.
 * It is illegal in Vermont to threaten someone or block their entrance
   to a health care facility that is providing them with gender
   affirming care.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Vermont has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Vermont 
 * Vermont will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Vermont will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Vermont via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 Act 14 - Sanctuary Law](https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2024/Docs/ACTS/ACT014/ACT014%20As%20Enacted.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

However, much of Vermont is considered reasonably safe.  That said,
attacks still can and do occur in Vermont.  Some areas may be more
swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric.  Burlington, in particular, is
known to tend towards LGBT friendliness.
