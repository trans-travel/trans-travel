# USA - Arizona

Arizona has several negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans visitors.

Arizona does criminalize some surgical trans care for children, but
does not generally criminalize such care, thus it appears that parents
visiting with trans children will not risk custody.

Note that same-sex marriage may not be recognized within some indigenous
nations.

## Non-discrimination Law

   marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
   marriages.

## General Safety

The state has a law that requires opt-in for public school instruction
on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

In addition because of transgender rhetoric, trans people have been
[blamed for at least one criem cimmited by another
person](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/man-accused-of-tagging-phoenix-warehouse-blamed-transgender-women-for-graffiti),
and trans people should be aware of sentiment that may cause them to be
seen as more prone to criminal behavior than cis people.
