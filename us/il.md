# United States - Illinois

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Illinois recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men. However, while non-binary people
lack some recognition (for instance, until 2024, will be unable to get
an "X" marker on their license), most laws are positive and there is
non-discrimination protection for trans people.

Illinois is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in Illinois non-discrimination laws.
 * Illinois has a religious freedom law that may provide religious exemptions
   to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Illinois.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans prisoners have typically been housed based on sex assigned at
   birth, rather than gender, denied medical care, and mistreated by
   guards. Some [are
   suing the state](https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/transgender-prison-idoc/).

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in Illinois.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
However, non-binary recognition is still in-complete in Illinois.
For example, "X" gender markers are not available on driver's licenses
in Illinois due to [bureaucratic reasons](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/25/20832644/pritzker-approves-non-binary-state-id-cards-drivers-licenses)
(the law allows this but the
company the state's current contract is with does not allow it).

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Illinois will not
   cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
   receiving care in Illinois for medical transition.
 * There is a religious exemption law that applies to limited medical
   situations in Illinois.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Illinois has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Illinois
 * Illinois will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While Illinois will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Illinois via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [Illinois Public Act 102-1117 (Sanctuary Law)](https://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/102/PDF/102-1117.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
