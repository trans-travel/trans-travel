# United States - New Jersey

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

New Jersey recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.

New Jersey is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care, through an executive order, although this order does not mention
impact to custody agreements.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in New Jersey non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in New Jersey.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While most jails/prisons have regulations that, in theory, would
   consider gender identity in housing decisions, these regulations are
   often ignored and trans people are often housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.
 * A widely publicized and sensationalized (including propaganda that
   was blatantly incorrect) case of consensual sex involving a trans woman in
   a state women's prison has been used to justify policy changes that
   make it easier to house a trans woman improperly due to "reproductive
   concerns."

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in New Jersey.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still incomplete in New Jersey.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and New Jersey will not
   cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
   receiving care in New Jersey for medical transition.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * New Jersey has a sanctuary executive order for people obtaining
   transition-related medical care in New Jersey, although this does not
   mention custody.
 * New Jersey will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While New Jersey will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in New Jersey via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [EO 326 - Protecting Trans Healthcare](https://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20230404/da/af/9c/05/b7356a0f2fcad2a7052a4713/EO-326.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

Politically, New Jersey has felt it appropriate to utilize the law when
political subdivisions attempt to violate the rights of transgender
students by, for example, [suing a discriminatory school
