# USA - California

California recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.

California is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in California non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in California.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](../notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * State prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
   housing decisions, but may or may not comply with requests of
   prisoners.
 * City and county jail policies are not covered by the state law.
 * Even where good policies exist, they usually mirror federal guidance
   which says gender identity must be taken into consideration for
   housing decisions. However, in practice this consideration can matter
   very little and correctional officers will value their own biases
   more than the trans person's gender identity.
 * San Diego is known to inappropriately house trans prisoners. For instance,
   in 2020, a trans woman placed in male jail in San Diego was [beaten badly
   by male inmates](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-news/transgender-woman-recalls-beating-in-san-diego-county-jail).
 * Los Angeles is known to inappropriately house trans prisoners. In
   2023, a trans man was [housed in women's jail](https://news.yahoo.com/cant-die-video-shows-trans-100029056.html)
   after being required to show his genitals to a female jailer.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in California.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * California will not cooperate with other states who seek information
   about patients receiving care in California for medical transition.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * California has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in California
 * California will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition
 * A proposed bill, AB957, would consider parental views of a child's
   gender identity in custody decisions, favoring parents who affirm a
   child's identity.

While California will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in California via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.

However, much of California is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the major cities where many people are visibly trans. That said, attacks
still can and do occur in California, particularly around school board
meetings discussing LGBT policies and schools teaching LGBT schools. For
instance, LGBT supporters at Saticoy Elementary in North Hollywood were
attacked by anti-LGBT protesters (who also used anti-Semitic language),
leaving one LGBT supporter unresponsive during the protest [on June 2,
2023](https://www.thedailybeast.com/saticoy-elementary-school-pride-assembly-protest-erupts-in-violence).
Rural areas may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some
jurisdictions outside of the major metro areas have attempted to restrict
the rights of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries. For
instance, an elected official uses his social media platform to [misgender a trans
constituent](https://krcrtv.com/news/local/shasta-county-office-of-education-board-member-faces-possible-censure)
Murrieta Valley School District [approved transphobic
policies](https://www.advocate.com/education/murrieta-valley-outing-transgender-students),
and Chino Valley School District has approved anti-LGBT policies.  Thus it is
important to recognize that California is not unified and does not have a
single view of trans people.

In addition, beyond political events and education, other violence has
occurred in California, sometimes not being restricted to the queer
community, but also impacting allies, such as the [murder of a
66-year-old mother of nine because the shooter disliked her pride
flag](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/20/1194932544/lauri-carleton-california-store-owner-killed-pride-flag-lgbtq)
that she was flying at her shop in support of the LGBT community.
