# USA - North Carolina

North Carolina does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly.

North Carolina does ban trans care for children, although the current law does
not have criminal penalties for parents.  However, it is unknown how this
might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * North Carolina non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * North Carolina, famously, passed an anti-trans bathroom law that was later
   repealed. In a compromise, the repeal legislation prohibited any
   local non-discrimination ordinances from being passed up until 2020.
   That provision has since expired.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in North Carolina.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * North Carolina does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * In Brevard, [violent death
   threats](https://localnews8.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2023/07/27/brevard-man-accused-of-using-fake-social-media-account-to-make-death-threats-against-drag-show/)
   were made against an adult drag show (and any pride events) in July,
   2023. The man responsible was arrested towards the end of July for the
   threats.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women may or may not be housed with men
 * Trans men may or may not be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * North Carolina has been the target of lawsuits over failing to allow
   inmates not already on HRT prior to incarceration to be prescribed HRT,
   denial of surgery, and inappropriate (wrong gender) housing.
 * An intersex prisoner alleges in a lawsuit that they contracted HIV
   due to inappropriate housing in a men's institution.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
   under 18 is illegal.  There is an exception for continuation of care
   for people under care prior to August 1, 2023, but this exception
   allows civil action still, so care is likely to be discontinued for all
   youth.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, although
   it is not legal to provide so it may have impacts on child custody.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized
 * Officials can excuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses on the
   basis of religious objections.

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade four in schools.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

In Waynesville, NC, a trans woman using the recreation center had [false
allegations spread about
her](https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/36046-a-rush-to-judgement-the-mere-existence-of-trans-people-is-not-a-crime)
by local religious leaders and others who claimed she was exposing
herself to children (evidence has shown this could not have happened).
Fortunately police responded to these complaints rightly noting that the
woman was not violating any laws (or doing anything at all improper).  Violent
threats were also made in Brevard in July 2023 against a drag show.
