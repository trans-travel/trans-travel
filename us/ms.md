# USA - Mississippi

Mississippi has negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people traveling to Mississippi in most situations.

Mississippi does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law does not have criminal penalties for parents.  However, it is unknown
how this might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Mississippi non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Mississippi has broad religious exemption laws that specifically
   allow for targeted discrimination against trans people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Mississippi.
 * Mississippi has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Some cities/counties have non-discrimination laws, but the state's
   religious freedom laws would likely override these if the person
   discriminating was covered by them.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Mississippi does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While Mississippi has a policy at the state level specifically noting
   gender identification as a component in housing decisions, the policy
   lists first and foremost "inmate's physical sexual characteristics"
   as a factor.
 * Trans women are typically housed with men
 * Trans men are typically housed with women
 * Nonbinary people are typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

Mississippi has a difficult process of changing gender on ID and birth
certificates, reflecting a state belief that sex assigned at birth
should typically reflect the gender of people.

Non-binary people are not legally recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
   under 18 is illegal.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Mississippi, although
   penalties will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
