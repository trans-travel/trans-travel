# United States - Mississippi

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Mississippi has negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people traveling to Mississippi in most situations.

Mississippi legally defines sex according to sex assigned at birth and
restrict bathroom and changing room usage at publicly owned or operated
educational facilities (this may include university hospitals and athletic
facilities such as stadiums). Regardless of governor signature, and
inside or outside of educational institutions, this may subject trans people
to harassment in restrooms.

Mississippi does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law does not have criminal penalties for parents.  However, it is unknown
how this might have an impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Mississippi non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Mississippi has broad religious exemption laws that specifically
   allow for targeted discrimination against trans people.

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Mississippi.
 * Trans and intersex people are required to use bathrooms according to
   sex assigned at birth within publicly (any level of government) owned
   or operated educational facility (updated May 13, 2024). This may
   apply to university-run hospitals, stadiums, etc.
 * It is likely Black women, lesbian women, muscular women, and tall
   women will face harassment in facilities in Mississippi, even if these women
   are cis (non-trans).  These women should also use extreme caution in
   Mississippi.
 * Mississippi has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Some cities/counties have non-discrimination laws, but the state's
   religious freedom laws and bathroom laws will override these if the
   person discriminating was covered by them.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Mississippi does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Cruise / Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While Mississippi has a policy at the state level specifically noting
   gender identification as a component in housing decisions, the policy
   lists first and foremost "inmate's physical sexual characteristics"
   as a factor.
 * [HB188](https://legiscan.com/MS/drafts/HB188/2025) requires
   trans people to be housed according to their sex assigned at birth.
 * Trans women are typically housed with men
 * Trans men are typically housed with women
 * Nonbinary people are typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

Mississippi has a difficult process of changing gender on ID and birth
certificates, reflecting a state belief that sex assigned at birth
should typically reflect the gender of people.

Non-binary people are not legally recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

A 16-year-old was denied a name change by Mississippi Supreme Court
because the name change was due to gender transition, and the teen must
now [wait until he is
21](https://www.advocate.com/law/mississippi-transgender-teen-name-change)
to request the name change (updated: April 18, 2025).

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
   under 18 is illegal.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.
 * Some medical providers, such as University of Mississippi Medical
   Center (UMMC) [cut off transgender care for youth before they were
   required to by
   law](https://mississippitoday.org/2023/04/26/facing-political-pressure-ummc-cut-care-to-trans-kids-before-the-legislature-banned-doing-so-emails-show/).
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Mississippi due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).
 * If [SB 2867](https://legiscan.com/MS/bill/SB2867/2025) is passed (it
   is not fully passed as of Mar. 14, 2025, but likely will be), all
   funding of trans healthcare under medicaid will be banned.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Mississippi, although
   penalties will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Any traveler should use extreme caution if they are not both cis and
have a very stereotypical gender presentation, if they use
any changing room in a government owned or controlled facility that is
open to the public, such as public parks, pools, sports facilities,
recreation centers, universities, etc.  A person may be arrested for
suspicion of violating this law and be required to produce either their
original birth certificate or amended birth certificate plus evidence of
bottom surgery, for presentation in court at a trial, if arrested.
While this is not legal advice, simply telling a police officer your sex
assigned at birth matches the facility or your usage of the exception
for trans people with updated birth certificate and bottom surgery.

In some cases, this may also apply to bathrooms and in facilities not
owned or controlled by the government, if law enforcement feels you
"loitered" in the wrong bathroom.  Thus Mississippi cannot be considered a safe
state for trans people, even if they feel they can meet the letter of
the law.

Because of the passage of several laws, and the widespread press
coverage, extreme caution should be used in all changing facilities and
bathrooms for anyone that is not unambiguously presenting following
stereotypes of their sex assigned at birth. This applies not just to
trans people, but to anyone else who does not follow gender expression
stereotypes (such as cis women with facial hair or short hair, men with
gynecomastia, etc).  Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the
political and media space, trans people should use caution, particularly
in bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks
may occur, and trans people who report these attacks can expect to be
misgendered by officials and public institutions.
