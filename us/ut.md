# United States - Utah

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Utah has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.

Utah legally defines sex according to sex assigned at birth, restricts
bathroom and changing room usage, and may subject trans
people to harassment in restrooms.

Utah does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).

Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from Utah's
and may lack some protections.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Utah non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people in public
   accommodations (it does include LGBT people in employment and
   housing).
 * Under law, the government is required to discriminate against
   trans people, both by defining sex by sex assigned at birth and
   restricting toilet and changing room usage by trans people in
   government owned or controlled facilities.

## Public Accommodations

 * Utah has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   many services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Under law (HB257), the government is required to discriminate against
   against trans people, both by defining sex by sex assigned at birth
   and restricting changing room usage by trans people in government
   owned or controlled facilities.  Trans people would be required to
   use changing rooms in publicly owned or controlled facilities in
   accordance with sex assigned at birth unless they update their birth
   certificate's gender marker to a new binary marker AND have had
   unambiguous binary bottom surgery in line with stereotypes for the
   new gender marker.
 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms according to sex assigned
   at birth within K12 schools.
 * Trans people who have BOTH updated their birth certificate and had
   bottom surgery to conform with binary stereotypes may then use either
   bathroom or changing room in publicly owned facilities.  This is
   because a person can use a changing room in line with their sex
   (defined as sex assigned at birth) OR the other binary sex if their
   birth certificate and post-surgical genitals match the other binary
   sex.  That said, indecent exposure law might then apply if genitals
   that don't match the sign on the door were exposed.
 * Trans people who have had bottom surgery but not changed their birth
   certificate are banned from using either changing room in government
   owned/controlled facilities on the basis of indecent exposure law.
 * Intersex people may use the appropriate facility, although intersex
   people who have genitals that are too male or too female for the
   changing room door in publicly owned/controlled changing rooms may
   not be able to use the appropriate room if their genitals may be exposed.
 * While bathroom usage outside of K12 bathrooms (for bathrooms without
   shower or changing facilities) is not directly regulated in Utah's
   law, several laws on indecent exposure and "loitering in a privacy
   space" could apply to trans people who do not have genitals that
   match the bathroom's designation AND a birth certificate that match
   the bathroom's designation. In addition, if using a bathroom other
   than one that matches the trans person's sex assigned at birth, these
   laws would likely also apply if the person has not underwent bottom
   surgery.  That is, a trans person who has not changed their genitals
   or birth certificate is legally (but probably not physically) safest
   in a bathroom that matches their sex assigned at birth, while one
   that has changed both in a binary way should use the bathroom that
   matches their genitals and document. People who do not have genitals
   in accordance with their birth certificate should use extreme
   caution.
 * It is likely Black women, lesbian women, muscular women, and tall
   women will face harassment in facilities in Utah, even if these women
   are cis (non-trans).  These women should also use extreme caution in
   Utah.
 * Utah has set up a [reporting
   website](https://ut-sao-special-prod.web.app/sex_basis_complaint.html)
   for bathroom and other violations of transphobic law, which encourage
   attachment of pictures.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Utah
 * However, at least one city (St. George) is using an obscure city
   ordinance to block permits for a drag event. This is being challenged
   in court, with a [preliminary
   injunction](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.139943/gov.uscourts.utd.139943.63.0.pdf)
   granted to allow drag to proceed in public spaces.

## Air Travel

Note that Salt Lake City Airport is a hub for Delta.  Because of
bathroom law and the hostile anti-trans environment, travelers may want to 
avoid this airport for connections.

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

There are transphobic TSA agents known to work at the Salt Lake City
airport. While not all TSA agents are transphobic, travelers should be
prepared for the possibility of TSA agents that refuse to touch trans
travelers for patdowns (requiring supervisor intervention) due to
transphobia.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are required to be housed with men.
 * Trans men are required to be housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.
 * The US Department of Justice [found the state prison system violated
   the
   ADA](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-03/letter_of_findings-utah_department_of_corrections.pdf)
   by having blanket bans on more appropriate housing, access to
   commissary items, conducting pat downs by inappropriate persons,
   conducting genital inspections, and other violations.  As of March
   12, 2024, the State has not responded to this finding or entered into
   a consent decree, so these conditions should be considered ongoing.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized in limited ways.

Utah laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.

Utah allows gender marker changes on IDs in some circumstances.  It is
unknown how law passed in 2024 may impact this.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
   However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
   providers). While the law itself does allow for the possibility of
   hormone treatment of trans youth, in theory, the provisions are
   extremely restrictive and place doctors at extreme financial risk,
   resulting in this making it effectively a ban as any Utah provider would be
   willing to take the risk of prescribing HRT or puberty blockers to
   trans youth.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
   puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
   of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
   would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
   marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
   marriages.

## General Safety

Any traveler should use extreme caution if they are not both cis and
have a very stereotypical gender presentation, if they use
any changing room in a government owned or controlled facility that is
open to the public, such as public parks, pools, sports facilities,
recreation centers, universities, etc.  A person may be arrested for
suspicion of violating this law and be required to produce either their
original birth certificate or amended birth certificate plus evidence of
bottom surgery, for presentation in court at a trial, if arrested.
While this is not legal advice, simply telling a police officer your sex
assigned at birth matches the facility or your usage of the exception
for trans people with updated birth certificate and bottom surgery.

In some cases, this may also apply to bathrooms and in facilities not
owned or controlled by the government, if law enforcement feels you
"loitered" in the wrong bathroom.  Thus Utah cannot be considered a safe
state for trans people, even if they feel they can meet the letter of
the law.

Because of the passage of HB257, and the widespread press coverage, extreme
caution should be used in all changing facilities and bathrooms for anyone
that is not unambiguously presenting following stereotypes of their sex
assigned at birth. This applies not just to trans people, but to anyone
else who does not follow gender expression stereotypes (such as cis
women with facial hair or short hair, men with gynecomastia, etc).

Due to the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
