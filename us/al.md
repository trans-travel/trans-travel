# United States - Alabama

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Alabama has negative laws towards trans people. A pending law (as of
Feb. 20, 2025) not yet signed by the governor would explicitly define
sex as sex assigned at birth and would apply to educational
institutions and state agencies.

Alabama does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Alabama non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, namely
   Birmingham and Montevallo.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools,
   including public universities and university-run programs, such as
   medical organizations that are part of public universities. They are
   also may be required to use facilities associated with sex assigned
   at birth in state government facilities.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Alabama.
 * Alabama has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Alabama does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are housed with men.
 * Trans men are housed with women
 * Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth
 * Trans people are required to be housed according to sex assigned at
   birth. (Updated May 26, 2025)

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.  The limited recognition of trans people in
the state often requires proof of surgery.

SB79 has wide-ranging transphobic impacts on the definitions of sex in the
state of Alabama.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
   people under 19 (including 18-year-olds) has passed and became law.
 * Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are criminalized.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.
 * In an abortion case, the Attorney General has indicated that
   assisting someone with transportation out-of-state for abortion could
   be [considered
   conspiracy](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23932753-yellowhammer-fund-et-al-v-steve-marshall-and-west-alabama-womens-center-et-al-v-steve-marshall).
   That law is similar to the anti-trans youth healthcare ban, thus people
   should be aware that when visiting Alabama, many actions that don't
   involve Alabama may be considered criminal conspiracy by the head law
   enforcement officer in the state.
 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools,
   including public universities and university-run programs, such as
   medical organizations that are part of public universities.  The public
   university provision takes effect on October 1, 2024.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Alabama due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
   for youth and teens (note this applies to people who are 18-years-old
   as the age of majority in Alabama is 19) is illegal, in a law entitled
   the "Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act."  This law
   is blocked from enforcement (for the puberty blocker and hormone
   therapy aspects) by court while litigation proceeds, but shows the
   state's view of this care.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

 * [2024 SB129 Public University Medical
   Ban](https://www.legislature.state.al.us/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2024RS/SB129-enr.pdf)

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 5 in schools. It
also bans much of cultural-studies curriculum (gender studies, Black studies,
etc) at public universities under 2024 SB129.

Politicians at the state and national level have weighed in on the idea
that trans people should not be employed anywhere children are present,
with [Alabama's Senators and
others](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/03/right-wing-officials-gang-up-to-lob-vicious-attacks-on-a-single-transgender-space-camp-employee/)
expressing that a Space Camp employee who is trans should be fired. Note
that there is no allegation of wrongdoing, simply anger that the
employee is trans.  While visitors are not directly impacted by this,
they should be aware of the public, high-profile anti-trans hate being
spread by powerful government officials, and that can impact
interactions and encounters in Alabama.

Birmingham has been called out as welcoming by a contributor ("hub of
all queerness"), and may be more welcoming than some other places.
Likewise, Mobile has also been noted for having Decadence, the first
Mardi Gras parade, the Prancing Elites, has the Fruit Loop which
includes one of the only lesbian bars in the country, and politicians and
organizations who have supported gay people historically.  That said,
municipalities have limited power and cannot override state laws.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
