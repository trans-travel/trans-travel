# United States - Washington

Washington is one of the safer states for trans people in the United
States. This does not mean to expect full equality in all instances, but
the letter of the law is generally non-discriminatory. Sex and gender
are treated the same under WA state law.

Washington explicitly protects trans medical care, including for
children. Care providers and homes for runaway you are not required to
notify parents in most cases that children receive gender-affirming
care. Washington does have a sanctuary law.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Washington non-discrimination law does protects LGBTQIA+ people,
   including trans people explicitly, including public accommodations,
   housing, employment, credit, and insurance.
 * Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.
 * Washington does not have religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   services on the basis of gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people may use appropriate bathrooms and locker rooms, protected
   by law.
 * General public accommodation access is specifically protected by law for
   trans people in Washington.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Washington does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.
 * Illegal acts of violence, including gunfire, have happened at some
   drag events.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Incarceration of trans people is at the discretion of Washington's
   Department of Corrections. According to policy, they must take into
   consider safety on a case-by-case basis, and as such, there is no
   guarantee a trans inmate will be housed according to their gender.
 * The state settled in October, 2023 with Disability Rights Washington.
   The settlement [requires better treatment of trans
   prisoners](https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/drw-reaches-agreement-with-doc-to-improve-care-for-transgender-people-with-disabilities/)
   by the Dept. of Corrections, including medical care, and access to
   gender-affirming clothing. This impacts state facilities (but not
   local or federal facilities).

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * By law, gender is based upon gender identity/expression, regardless
   of assigned gender at birth.
 * Non-binary people are recognized and X is available as a gender
   marker on state ID/forms.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * Some surgeries are available for trans youth.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care does not fall under the definition of child abuse.
 * There is a sanctuary law to protect access to gender-affirming care in
   WA.
 * There is now a new (2023) sanctuary law to protect trans kids receiving
   care from estranged parents, although this is largely untested law.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized
 * Marriages are recognized regardless of sex/gender. Marriage equality
   was both enacted by the government and defended by popular vote
   (Referendum 74).
 * "Marriage is a civil contract between two persons who have each
   attained the age of eighteen years, and who are otherwise capable."

## Schools

 * The state has a law that requires opt-out for public school instruction
   on sexual orientation or gender identity. Sex education is required to
   be inclusive, but also required to promote abstinence (although not
   exclusively).

## General Safety

As with most states, trans people are mostly safest in major cities,
college towns, etc. Seattle has a large trans community, but Spokane,
Olympia, and similar town may also be decent refuges. The rural areas
are less predictable. While the author has taken trips to such areas,
the protection of the law may not be enough there.
