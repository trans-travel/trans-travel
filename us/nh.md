# United States - New Hampshire

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

New Hampshire does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  However, if HB396 is
signed, this may significantly impact trans travelers by removing
protections for trans people and requiring discrimination against trans
people in several cases, including bathrooms.

New Hampshire criminalizes some surgical trans care for children, but does
not generally criminalize other gender-related care, thus it appears that
parents visiting with trans children will not risk custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * New Hampshire non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.
   If HB396's veto is overridden, however, that would change, and trans people
   would be explicitly excluded for some protections, including bathroom
   access.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
   However, if HB396's veto is overridden, these protections would be eliminated
   and certain facilities would be restricted on the basis of
   transphobic definitions of sex.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * New Hampshire does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men. However, if HB396's
   veto is overridden, this would always be the case.
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women. However, if HB396's
   veto is overridden, is
   signed, this would always be the case.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth. However, if HB396's veto is overridden, this would always
   be the case.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in New Hampshire, such as
state IDs, but not birth certificates.

However, if HB396's veto is overriden, transphobic definitions of sex would
apply in some cases.

## Medical Care

 * Genital surgery for youth is banned as of July 19, 2024.
 * Other trans medical care is legal for adults and children.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse.
   However, genital surgery is banned for youth. This is unlikely to affect
   most families with trans children.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Visitors should be cautious as HB396 may impact trans and gender non-conforming
cis people if the veto is overridden.

Littleton, NH, considered a ban on all public art displays because some art
was created to [express inclusion
themes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-hampshire-town-art-debate-1.7014430).
This town also decided to not renew a lease for a local theater company which
performed a play that included LGBT characters.  However, the official
responsible for the attempt at banning art [did not run for
re-election](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=630&inflect=2).

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
