# United States - Idaho

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Idaho has negative laws towards trans people. These laws may, in some
cases, impact travelers.  In particular, medical professionals,
government employees, and people working for public colleges and
universities are allowed to discriminate.  There are also laws that
can be interpreted to limit bathroom access for trans people.

Idaho does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Idaho non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Idaho allows all levels of government employees and public school
   employees (including higher education employees) to refuse to
   recognize names other than legal names. This also allows these
   same people to willingly misgender trans people.

## Public Accommodations

 * According to law, trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers
   associated with their sex assigned at birth when using some
   bathrooms/showers in schools. However, this is [being
   challenged](https://lambdalegal.org/case/roe-v-critchfield/)
   in court (updated Mar. 20, 2025).
 * Enforcement of school bathroom regulations is unclear.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
   Idaho.
 * Idaho has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.
 * Idaho has a law that prevents all levels of government from enforcing
   any bathroom non-discrimination laws on businesses and organizations
   that contract with government. (Example: homeless shelters,
   businesses that contract with the state, private schools that get
   state money, etc).
 * Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
   but it is unclear how that is reconciled with state law.
 * Idaho allows all levels of government employees and public school employees
   (including higher education employees) to refuse to recognize names
   other than legal names. This also allows these same people to willingly
   misgender trans people. This may affect some public accommodations and
   tourist attractions.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Currently, no ban on drag performance

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are usually housed with men
 * Trans men are usually housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * While the state lost a lawsuit and was required to provide gender
   confirmation surgery to a prisoner, it should be expected that
   medical care will be sub-par. The state also aggressively fought to
   deny care, and would be expected to do so in the future.
 * Therapists, who may be gatekeepers for trans medicine in prison
   systems, can use 2024 S1352 to refuse to provide trans-related
   care.
 * Idaho allows all government employees, including law enforcement,
   jail, and prison employees at all levels of government to refuse to
   recognize names other than legal names.  This also allows those employees
   to misgender trans employees and others.  This will allow those working
   in jails and prisons this right to discrimination.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Idaho defines sex based on sex assigned at birth.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex are not recognized.
 
## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * If H0345 is signed by the governor, it would ban Medicaid and other
   state funds to be used for adult trans care (updated Mar. 17, 2025).
 * Trans medical care is illegal for anyone under 18 (including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery. This law is [being
   challenged](https://www.acluidaho.org/en/news/idaho-families-sue-block-idahos-ban-health-care-trans-youth),
   but is currently in effect.
 * Therapists can use 2024 S1352 to discriminate against trans persons.
 * If [H0345](https://legiscan.com/ID/bill/H0345/2025) is signed by the
   governor, it would prevent medicaid funds being used for trans
   healthcare (verified Mar. 17, 2025).
 * If [H0059](https://legiscan.com/ID/drafts/H0059/2025) is signed by
   the governor, it would allow disclosure of medical information when a
   violation of healthcare law (including transphobic laws) is
   suspected (verified Mar. 17, 2025).
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old.
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government. (Verified Mar. 17, 2025)

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Idaho has passed a trans medical care ban for youth (puberty blockers,
   hormones, surgeries are illegal under this law).
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

Idaho has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy.

Organized hate groups have attempted to riot and potentially use
violence against LGBT events.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
