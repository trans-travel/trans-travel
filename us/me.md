# United States - Maine

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Maine does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people. While Maine does not
have a sanctuary law, the state generally is proactive in legally
protecting trans people.

Maine is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

Maine does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Maine non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
 * In Doe v. Regional School Unit 26, in 2014, the Maine Supreme Court
   recognize the right to use a bathroom associated with someone's
   gender identity in public school settings.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Maine does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women may or may not be housed with women, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
   Genital state is considered highly relevant.
 * Trans men may or may not be housed with men, although policy at
   the state prison level is that this be taken into consideration.
   Genital state is considered highly relevant.
 * Nonbinary people may or may not be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

state IDs.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * Maine has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in Colorado
 * Maine will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

   medical care in Colorado

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

Oakland, ME, has been accused by the former city manager of being
[transphobic towards
her](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/10/10/news/central-maine/oakland-accepts-resignation-transgender-town-manager-bias/),
leading to her resignation as city manager.
