# United States - Maryland

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Maryland does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  The state generally is
proactive in legally protecting trans people.

Maryland is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Maryland non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Maryland does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women have sued both the state and counties over inappropriate
   housing, poor medical care, and sexual assault in jails and prison.
   These lawsuits are ongoing.
 * Trans prisoners in state prisons are [housed according to
   genitalia](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/maryland-trans-prisoners-compliance-prea-6MFYNZQ3UZFYJMX34TO4QJEQ4E/)
   (checked Feb. 23, 2024).
 * Nonbinary people may or may not be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in Maryland, such as
state IDs, but this recognition is not yet complete.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.
 * Maryland has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care.
 * A pending bill would [further protect trans care medical
   records](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb1085?ys=2025RS)
   if signed by the Governor (updated Apr. 4, 2025).
 * Maryland will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2025 HB1045 - Confidentiality of Medical Records (not yet signed by Governor as of Apr. 4, 2025)](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb1085?ys=2025RS)
 * [EO 01.01.2023.08 Maryland Sanctuary Order](https://governor.maryland.gov/Lists/ExecutiveOrders/Attachments/11/EO_01.01.2023.08_accessible.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
