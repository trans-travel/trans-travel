# United States - Georgia

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Georgia negative laws towards trans people. These laws should generally
not impact adult travelers to Georgia, although Georgia also lacks many
non-discrimination protections.

Georgia does criminalize some trans care for children (hormone therapy
and surgery).

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Georgia non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * [SB36](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB36/2025) limits government powers
   when discrimination is blamed on religion (updated Apr. 9, 2025).

## Public Accommodations

 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Georgia.
 * Schools (including universities) and government divisions must ban trans
   people from bathrooms when connected to sports competitions. This may apply
   to spectators. (Updated Apr. 9, 2025)
 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Georgia does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Prisons and local jails would be prohibited from prohibited from
   providing gender affirming medical care to prisoners under
   [SB185](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB185/id/3201621) if it is
   signed by the Governor. (updated Apr. 12, 2025)

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized by Georgia.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * Medical care for transgender children is restricted. While puberty
   blockers are legal, hormone therapy and surgery are illegal.
 * The youth healthcare ban is being [challenged in
   court](https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/press-release-georgia-parents-seek-emergency-court-order-blocking-anti-transgender).
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Georgia due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some trans medical care is illegal youth in Georgia, although puberty
   blockers are legal (hormones and surgeries are illegal)
 * It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
   custody removal.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2025 SB185 - Prisoner Healtchare Ban (not yet signed by Governor as
   of Apr. 12, 2025)](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB185/id/3201621)
 * [2025 SB1 - Sports/Bathroom Ban](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB1/2025)
 * [2025 SB36 - Protections if Transphobia Blamed on God](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB36/2025)

## General Safety

Georgia has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using hormone replacement therapy.

A "Don't say gay" bill [banning discussion of student's sexual
orientation, student's gender identity, or sexual education
topics](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB88/id/2679859) without written
parental permission in schools until Age 16 has been re-introduced during an
out-of-session committee meeting in August, 2023. While this is not law,
visitors who may be presenting material in Georgia schools should keep
track of this law. The proposed, but not passed, bill also requires student
names to be maintained under their initial enrollment name, reflecting a
possible belief by legislatures that other types of name changes (such
as changing a last name to avoid association with an abuser) are not
appropriate for children.

A fire at a trans healthcare clinic [was caused by arson and is being
investigated as a hate
crime](https://www.advocate.com/news/gender-care-clinic-arson-georgia).
The clinic, in Decatur, a progressive, generally LGBT-friendly city,
provides services to the trans community.  This indicates that violent
anti-trans activity may target visible trans organizations.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

However, there are visible LGBT communities in some cities (Atlanta,
Savannah) which may have some degree of safety.  This is
in-spite of the law, not because of the law. Atlanta's leaders, in particular,
has given [public support to trans
people](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/atlanta-mayor-dickens-transgender-community-funding)

Police departments in Georgia may inaccurately gender crime victims (for
instance, [Macon Police misgendered a trans woman murder
victim](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/deputies-identify-23-year-old-found-shot-death-empty-parking-lot/BXOK2FMBQZHIXDLGGGWLAPKYTA/)).
