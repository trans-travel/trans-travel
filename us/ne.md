# United States - Nebraska

Nebraska has some negative law and executive orders towards trans people
that affect almost all trans travelers. In particular, due to an
[executive
order](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/30/nebraska-gov-pillen-enacts-second-governor-led-womens-bill-of-rights/),
all Nebraska executive agencies will default to considering trans women
as men, and trans men as women, while non-binary people will be
considered their sex assigned at birth. This likely will apply to bathroom
and facility access of facilities under state regulation (such as airports,
rest areas, many parks) and can place trans people at significant risk.

SNebraska bans trans youth medical care with very narrow and limited
exceptions for continuing care.  It has an unknown impact on child
custody, although it should be noted that the law applies to medical
providers and not parents.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Nebraska non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically
 * Omaha has a local non-discrimination law that applies to gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * State facilities likely will fall under an executive order that
   defines sex as sex assigned at birth, and will be required to enforce
   that in all state regulations enacted by executive branch agencies.
   This may in some cases impact private businesses, cities, schools,
   and other non-state entities.
 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Nebraska.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Nebraska does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

Note that the executive order defining sex may make state facilities
particularly risky for trans travelers.

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are required to be housed with men
 * Trans men are required to be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth

## Legal Definition of Sex

The State of Nebraska, via [executive
order](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/30/nebraska-gov-pillen-enacts-second-governor-led-womens-bill-of-rights/),
defines trans people based on sex assigned at birth.  This is
wide-ranging and includes all executive branch agencies.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Trans medical care is [restrictively regulated](https://dhhs.ne.gov/Documents/181-NAC-8.pdf)
   for people under 19 (Note that this includes
   18-year-olds).  However, parents would not be criminalized (the
   bill would apply to medical providers)
 * The current executive order for bathroom access conflicts with parts
   of the youth healthcare regulations, in that it may be impossible for
   a person to live in their gender for 6 months (a requirement to
   receive hormone blockers and HRT under the regulations).
 * Therapy required for youth to obtain puberty blockers or HRT is required
   to be "neutral", I.E. it must not be affirming
   (or conversion therapy). This would tend to imply that a provider
   using proper pronouns for a trans youth would be violating the law.
   40 contact hours, with no more than 2 hours per week, is required for
   access to puberty blockers or hormones.
 * HRT pickup from pharmacies is highly regulated for youth and is
   required to "out" the trans youth (including 18-year-olds).
 * Surgical procedures are banned for youth, including 18-year-olds.
 * The ACLU of Nebraska is challenging the youth healthcare ban.
 * Despite the law allowing youth previously receiving healthcare to
   continue to receive it, [some pharmacies are refusing to
   dispense](https://www.expresshealthcaremgmt.com/news2/nebraska-lawmaker-says-some-report-pharmacists-are-refusing-to-fill-gender-confirming-prescriptions/126721/)
   medication to transgender youth.
 * Providers have indicated that the new rules for trans youth
   healthcare [are unclear and may be impossible to
   follow](https://www.aol.com/mess-nebraska-gender-affirming-care-100000314.html)

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

 * [2023 LB574 - Trans Youth Medical Care Ban](https://legiscan.com/NE/text/LB574/2023)
 * [Regulations on trans youth health
   care](https://rules.nebraska.gov/rules?agencyId=37&titleId=110) (See
   chapter "8" here for most recent published regulations; note as of
   March 12, 2024, currently in-force regulations where not published)

## General Safety

Nebraska's executive order defining men and women based on sex assigned
at birth creates an openly hostile state for trans travelers. This law
does not depend upon surgical status, genitals, government ID, birth
certificate, or any other "proof" of transition, and is wide-ranging
across all state government programs and services.

Nebraska has seen very widely publicized hate crimes against LGBT
people.  While these crimes may occur anywhere, and most anti-LGBT hate
crimes, even of the severity of the notorious crimes committed in NE,
are not publicized when they occur (and, again, can and do occur nearly
everywhere in the USA), this may be a concern to some travelers.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions. As one example, a trans man chose to
use the women's bathroom in an Omaha bar, and announced that he was
"biologically female," yet [was attacked by another
man](https://www.wowt.com/2024/06/08/transgender-man-speaks-alleged-assault-omaha-bar/)
in April, 2024.
