# United States - Washington DC

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

DC recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.

DC is a "sanctuary city" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.

However, significant parts of the USA federal government are controlled
by anti-trans politicians, and on November 20, 2024, the head of
Congress has issued a statement that trans people are to be banned from
any bathroom not aligned with their sex assigned at birth in the Capitol
Building complex (Capitol, Library of Congress, and Capitol office
buildings). It is likely that as a new administration takes over, this
ban will be extended to other Federal properties in DC.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in DC non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms aligned with their sex
   assigned at birth in the US Capitol Complex (Capitol building,
   Library of Congress, congressional office buildings). It is unknown
   how this is/will-be enforced, or what penalties, if any, exist.
 * Otherwise, Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are
   comfortable in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.
   Legal documentation of your gender is not required for this
   protection.
 * Public accommodations/businesses with single-occupancy bathrooms are
   required to sign these for all gender and allow access to all
   genders.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in DC.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Jails and prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
   housing decisions.  However, this does not guarantee a proper
   placement, particularly if the prisoner is housed out-of-district.
 * In July 2025, a trans girl housed with cis boys was [seriously injured
   in an attack](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/trans-girl-housed-male-unit-jaw-broken-dc-juvenile-detention-center-rcna218960).

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be incomplete in DC.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * DC will not cooperate with other jurisdictions who seek information
   about patients receiving care in DC for medical transition.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * DC has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
   medical care in DC 
 * DC will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
   against medical transition

While DC will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in DC via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions. For instance, [police are
investigating](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/07/16/cayla-calhoun-beaten-lincoln-memorial/)
a possible anti-trans hate crime attack that occurred near the Lincoln Monument
(updated July 20, 2025).

Care should also be used when interacting with public officials or
protesting government action. On December 10, 2024, A cis man was arrested
and charged with assault after a handshake with a Republican US
Representative where he asked the representative to support trans children.
The Republican Representative claims this was an attack, which is
disputed by witnesses ([See this story in The
Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5035804-nancy-mace-handshake-dispute-arrest/)).
It is likely under full Republican control of all branches of Federal
government that previously allowed protest and advocacy activities may
result in criminal charges and/or detention.

However, much of DC is considered reasonably safe.  That said,
attacks still can and do occur in DC.
