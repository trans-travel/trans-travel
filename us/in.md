# United States - Indiana

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Indiana negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.

Indiana does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Indiana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people
 * Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
   Indianapolis-Marion County.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
   sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.
 * Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Indiana.
 * Indiana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
   some services on the basis of gender identity.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Indiana does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women would typically be housed with men
 * Trans men would typically be housed with women
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth
 * Indiana law bans transition-related surgeries for prisoners in state
   prisons.  This is being [challenged by the
   ACLU](https://www.aclu-in.org/en/press-releases/aclu-indiana-sues-idoc-over-new-law-bans-trans-medical-care-correctional-facilities).

## Legal Definition of Sex

Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.

State identification can be changed. Some identification may require a
court order, however, and some courts have proven resistant to changing
identification. In addition, for birth certificates, different appeals
courts have reached [different
decisions for children](https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judicial-uncertainty-continues-over-birth-certificate-changes-for-transgender-hoosiers/article_e2032d1e-ef6d-11ed-8865-7bb25f459685.html)
on changing the gender marker on birth certificates. However, the
Indiana Legal Service's LGBT Project can [provide
assistance](https://www.indianalegalservices.org/namegendermarkerfaq)
for this or other name-change issues.

Non-binary people are not recognized.

Intersex people have some limited recognition.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults
 * A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
   people under 18 has passed and became law.
 * Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
   blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
   law applies only to medical providers.
 * The state government has [engaged a conservative law
   firm](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/01/indiana-ag-enlists-dc-firm-to-investigate-transgender-care-providers/71770234007/)
   to sue providers for not disclosing risks of trans medical care. This
   is not being done to protect parents, but rather to intimidate
   providers and restrict care.
 * Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
   beliefs.
 * Conversion therapy is not banned and municipalities are banned from
   enacting rules banning conversion therapy.
 * Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
   Indiana due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
   July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
   protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
   state.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 30 January 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
   for children is illegal.  This ban shows the state's view of this care.
 * The Indiana Attorney General has stated, to hospitals providing youth
   care, that trans care is child abuse. While it remains legal (except
   for surgery) for trans youth, the state has made clear statements on
   how they view this care and people who provide it.
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## General Safety

The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 3 in schools.

A former student at Indiana University has accused the police department
of being [unwilling to fully
investigate](https://www.idsnews.com/article/2023/09/former-iu-student-declan-farley-posts-update-harassment-last-year)
anti-trans and anti-gay harassment.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
