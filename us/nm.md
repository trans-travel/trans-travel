# United States - New Mexico

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

New Mexico recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.

New Mexico does not appear to put custody at risk.

Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from New Mexico's
and may lack some protections.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Trans people are specifically named in New Mexico non-discrimination laws.
 * New Mexico has a religious freedom law that may provide religious
   exemptions to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
 * Public accommodations/businesses with single-occupancy bathrooms are
   required to sign these for all gender and allow access to all
   genders.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in New Mexico.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While most jails/prisons have regulations that, in theory, would
   consider gender identity in housing decisions, these regulations are
   often ignored and trans people are often housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

 * There is no legal definition of male/female in New Mexico.

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still incomplete in New Mexico.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * New Mexico does not have a sanctuary law.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * New Mexico does not have a sanctuary law.

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.
 * Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
   of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
   would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
   marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
   marriages.
 * It is unknown whether Zuni Pueblo recognizes same-sex marriages
   performed elsewhere.

## Relevant Laws

 * [2019 HB388 - Non-Gendered Bathrooms](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/19%20Regular/final/HB0388.pdf)
 * [Diné Marriage Act (Applicable in the Navajo Nation)](https://courts.navajo-nsn.gov/Resolutions/29-05%20Marriage%20Act.pdf)

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.
