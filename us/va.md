# United States - Virginia

Virginia does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly.
However, the Virginia executive branch has created "model policies" for
school districts that are discriminatory and thus there is the risk of
some school districts enacting discriminatory policies.

Virginia does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## Non-discrimination Law
 
 * Trans people are specifically named in Virginia non-discrimination laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
   in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
   documentation of your gender is not required for this protection,
   although access at schools may be at risk due to executive branch
   policies.
 * Virginia has a religious freedom law that may provide religious
   exemptions to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Virginia does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men.
 * Trans men are typically housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
   assigned at birth.
 * Trans people have sued Virginia over the denial of medical
   care for trans prisoners.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in Virginia.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse
 * There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
   jurisdictions
 * Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
   refuse services for religious reasons.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Virginia is a particularly divided state. While it has the nation's
first out trans state lawmaker (Danica Roem), it also has an anti-trans
governor and local governments may implement anti-LGBT policies, such as
the Warren County Board of Supervisors, which has threatened [defunding

over the presence of LGBT-inclusive books.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions. Far-right groups operate in Virginia,
and in at least one case a transgender organization in Norfolk was
