# United States - Michigan

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States

Michigan does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people. While Michigan does not
have a sanctuary law, the state generally is proactive in legally
protecting trans people.

Michigan does not appear to place child custody at risk.

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

As an example of recent attacks, on July 15, 2023, a disabled trans man
was [shot with a pellet gun while being called transphobic/homophobic
slurs](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/transgender-man-shot-with-pellet-gun-called-homophobic-and-transphobic-slurs-in-pontiac)
in Pontiac, MI.  At Michigan State University, a group of seven
high-school aged boys
[attacked two
