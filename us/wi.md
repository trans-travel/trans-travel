# United States - Wisconsin

This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at [General United States
Information](notes/usa-general.md).

Wisconsin does not have negative laws towards trans people.

Wisconsin is not a "sanctuary state", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Wisconsin non-discrimination law does not include trans people.
 * Many municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
   rooms.
 * General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
   for trans people in Wisconsin as a whole (but is in many municipalities).
 * Dane County established [limited sanctuary
   protections](https://www.countyofdane.com/PressDetail/11253) within
   the county, as did [Milwaukee
   County](https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/proposal-passes-to-make-milwaukee-county-a-sanctuary-county-for-transgender-non-binary-people).
   The City of Madison is also considering passing a
   [limited sanctuary resolution](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6258275&GUID=81B35D5F-1BC8-45D1-B9F1-7D5AE39ED497&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=police&FullText=1)
   that they would lower the priority of
   enforcement of any prosecutions related to transgender medical care.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Wisconsin does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.

## Air Travel

See the [USA TSA](notes/tsa.md) document.

## Jails / Prisons

 * Trans women are typically housed with men.
 * Trans men are typically housed with women.
 * Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at
   birth.
 * Wisconsin challenged trans medical care for inmates in court recently
   (and lost).
 * Legislation is being debated in the legislature as of November 3, 2023
   that would require transgender prisoners to be treated according to
   their sex assigned at birth.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Non-binary people are not recognized in Wisconsin.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for all ages.
 * Wisconsin does not have a "sanctuary" law.
 * A [federal executive
   order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)
   and hospitals seeking to limit their liability even before
   implementation of this order may make accessing care difficult or
   impossible for those under 19-years-old. (updated 13 February 2025).
   However, the government is prevented from implementing this order
   (thus hospitals are not bound by it) because of a [temporary
   restraining
   order](https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/02/093114651219.pdf)
   against the government (13 February 2025).

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * Transition care is not defined as child abuse
 * Wisconsin does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
   transition-related medical care.

## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized

   * [2023 SB438 - Treat trans prisoners according to sex assigned at
     birth (not yet passed as of December 6,
     2023)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/related/proposals/sb438)

## General Safety

Four Black trans women have been [killed in Milwaukee in a nine month
period between 2022 and
2023](https://milwaukeenns.org/2023/12/13/uptick-in-violence-has-milwaukees-trans-community-on-high-alert/).
This appears to be a significant increase in violence towards trans
people.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
