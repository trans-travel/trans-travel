# USA - Wisconsin

Wisconsin does not have negative laws towards trans people.

Wisconsin is not a "sanctuary state", but also does not criminalize
trans youth medical care.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * Many municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
   gender identity.

## Public Accommodations

   rooms.

   for trans people in Wisconsin as a whole (but is in many municipalities).
 * Dane County established [limited sanctuary
   protections](https://www.countyofdane.com/PressDetail/11253) within
   the county.  The City of Madison is also considering passing a
   [limited sanctuary resolution](https://madison.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6258275&GUID=81B35D5F-1BC8-45D1-B9F1-7D5AE39ED497&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=police&FullText=1)
   that they would lower the priority of
   enforcement of any prosecutions related to transgender medical care.

## General Safety

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.
