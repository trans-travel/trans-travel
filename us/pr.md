## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Puerto Rico has few protections for trans people.

Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.

While Puerto Rick has [high incidence of anti-trans violent
crimes](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/regional-reports-puerto-rico/),
and trans victims are frequently misgendered and deadnamed, there is
also some acceptance among others on the island, although the political
rhetoric is fueling an increase in hate crime.
