# Japan

## A Note

An American with limited knowledge of Japan law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to Japan.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.

## Summary

National LGBT protection law is weak, although some locations (including
Tokyo) have passed stronger local legislation.

## Non-discrimination Law

 * The [national LGBT
   law](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/07/12/japan-passes-law-promote-understanding-lgbt-people)
   is relatively weak, although some locations in Japan have passed
   stronger laws.

## Public Accommodations

 * Trans people can generally use appropriate toilets. Accessible, single-user
   bathrooms often exist, and these can be used by people of any gender.
   However, at least one trans woman, in 2022, was [referred to
   prosecution](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/police-refer-trans-woman-prosecutors-using-womens-bathroom/)
   for using the women's bathroom.  Thus caution should be exercised.
 * Public osens (baths) should likely be avoided by trans people who
   have not had genital surgeries. In addition, they prohibit people
   with tattoos. Private osens and yunessun with bathing suits may be a
   viable alternative.

## Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws

 * Japan does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.

## Air Travel

 * Travel into/out-of Japan will require tickets and documents to
   match, including gender.
 * In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers. It is
   unknown if these scanners are problematic for trans people.
 * It is unknown what policies exist around pat-down searches.

## Jails / Prisons

 * While in some cases, trans people have been housed according to their
   gender, this is likely the exception and trans people should be
   expected to be housed in accordance with sex assigned at birth,
   particularly if they have not had bottom surgery.
 * People will be searched in accordance to where they are housed.
 * Gender affirming care is not typically available in Japanese
   jails/prisons.

## Legal Definition of Sex

Binary trans people can change their gender with some significant
restrictions.

Non-binary gender is not recognized in the Japan.

## Medical Care

 * Trans medical care is legal for adults.
 * Trans medical care is typically not provided to youth.
 * Syringes are a controlled import item in Japan. You will need a
   [Yunyu Kakunin-sho
   permit](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html)
   to import syringes (even a single syringe) if it is not a pre-filled
   injector.

## Child Custody / Abuse

 * It is unknown how a child's transition may impact custody.
 
## Relationship Recognition

 * Same-sex marriage is not generally recognized, although this is an
   evolving area of law in Japan.

## Relevant Laws

## General Safety

Japan is generally a very safe country. Violent crime is relatively
rare.
