</nav></section> <section id='file-1'><h1 id="toc-1">Introduction</h1>

<p>This project seeks to provide "travel advice" for trans travelers
(and our companions) based on laws and practical
safety within various jurisdictions.</p>

<p>If you are viewing this at
<a href="https://TravelWhileTrans.com/">https://TravelWhileTrans.com/</a>,
you can select a jurisdiction using the sidebar on the left. On mobile,
you can click the "three bars" on the top left of the page which will
pull out the sidebar (or turn your phone sideways).</p>

<p>It is not geared towards people already living in a jurisdiction.
For instance, laws about medical insurance won't
generally be mentioned, as most people traveling will have
out-of-jurisdiction medical insurance. Likewise, laws about school
athletics will not be mentioned as these generally don't impact
travelers.  However, information that might impact travelers in
different situation will be mentioned. For instance, someone assigned to
a business project for several months in a state may need to utilize
medical care. Others may travel with children and be concerned about how
this could be seen as child abuse or cause child custody issues.</p>

<h1 id="toc-2">Other Formats</h1>

<p>This is also available as a PDF. This may be particularly useful to
people needing to cite this information or who want to carry a copy with
them on their mobile device.  You can access the PDF version at
<a href="https://TravelWhileTrans.com/output/trans-travel.pdf">https://TravelWhileTrans.com/output/trans-travel.pdf</a>.</p>

<h1 id="toc-3">Disclaimer</h1>

<p>This is not legal advice, and is not put together by a lawyer.  This
information is not guaranteed to be up-to-date or accurate.  You
should consult with an attorney with any questions.</p>

<h1 id="toc-4">Missing Jurisdictions</h1>

<p>This guide is definitely incomplete, and contains only a handful of
jurisdictions at this time.  Contributions of additional jurisdictions
are always appreciated.</p>

<h1 id="toc-5">A Note on Intersectional Oppression</h1>

<p>This directory is focused on laws and safety concerns that generally
impact trans people. However, not all trans people have the same safety
concerns, which is why I've refrained from saying a state might be
"safe" or "dangerous" directly, or giving scores/grades/etc.  For
instance, a wealthy trans person may be able to more safely visit a
specific jurisdiction than someone without class privilege. Likewise, a
person with white privilege might be safe in a place where a person who
does not have that privilege might not.  The intent is to not erase
these legitimate intersectional concerns, but to be a starting point for
your research.</p>

<h1 id="toc-6">Changes to this guide</h1>

<p>You can <a href="#file-85">view changes to the travel guide here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="toc-7">About "Bad Countries" and "Bad States"</h1>

<p>Trans people have always existed, and still do exist across all
cultures. A jurisdiction may be unsafe or have bad laws, but there will
still be trans people within that jurisdiction, and it's important to
consider them before fully writing off a state or country as not worth a
fight. In addition, there are accepting, open-minded allies in every
jurisdiction as well.</p>

<p>In addition, in both good and bad jurisdictions, there will be good and
bad treatment of trans people. The summaries in this project attempt to
summarize the situation for people, but they are just summaries. Any one
individual's situation may be different than what others face, both good
and bad.</p>

<h1 id="toc-8">Errors / Omissions</h1>

<p>This project welcomes contributions via pull requests or email to
Joelle Maslak <a href="mailto:jmaslak@antelope.net">jmaslak@antelope.net</a>.</p>

<p>The project is also available on Github as <a
href="https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel">https://github.com/trans-travel/trans-travel</a></p>

<p>Particularly interesting is general information from people that know
the location, beyond just what the laws say. If you know a city has a
great neighborhood for trans people, or that there is a disparity
between how one area of the country or state treats people and another,
this is extremely valuable information!</p>

<p>This project also welcomes contributions of new jurisdictions!
To add a new jurisdiction, please utilize the template in template.md if
you can.</p>

<h2>A Note</h2>

<p>An American with limited knowledge of BM law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to Bermuda.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While Bermuda does not recognize same-sex marriage and does not allow
gender reassignment, it does have some non-discrimination protections
for sexual orientation.</p>

<p>It does not have legal gender identity protections.</p>

<p>Bermuda does not appear to have law that makes it illegal for trans people
to use bathrooms, children to receive gender affirming medical care, or for
tran speople to dress differently than your sex assigned at birth.
However, because no positive law exists, discrimination would be legal.</p>

<p>Note that resorts and tourist areas may be more accepting than other
areas, and that some openly LGBT people do travel to Bermuda and enjoy
their trips.</p>

<p>The age of consent also differs depending on type of sex act, with anal
sex requiring the person to be age 18 or older (vs. PIV sex, where age
of consent is 16). For people 18 or older, having sex with others 18 or
older, there are no legal concerns.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no protections from discrimination on the basis of gender
identity in law.</li>
<li>There is some protections for LGB travellers to Bermuda, particularly
in public accommodations.</li>
<li>There is no recognition of same-sex marriage in Bermuda.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no protections from discrimination on the basis of gender
identity in law.</li>
<li>There is some protections for LGB travellers to Bermuda, particularly
in public accommodations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bermuda does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importation Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>People have been arrested for importing LGBT pornography in the past,
although it appears that this is not currently against the law.</li>
<li>While prescription medication is typically allowed, non-prescribed
medication may expose you to legal problems in Bermuda.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Travel into/out-of Bermuda may require tickets and documents to
match, including gender.</li>
<li>In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers. It is
unknown if these scanners have been programmed in a trans-affirming
way.</li>
<li>It is unknown what policies Bermuda applies to pat-down searches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other International Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is unknown what security and identity restrictions may exist for
ocean travel.</li>
<li>People have been arrested for importing LGBT pornography in the past,
although it appears that this is not currently against the law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is unknown how Bermuda houses transgender prisoners, although it
is likely according to either anatomy or assignment at birth. Most
likely trans women would be housed in men's jails or prisons.</li>
<li>Trans affirming medical care is likely unavailable in jails/prisons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>There is no recognition of legal gender change, and non-binary gender is
not recognized.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care appears legal for adults but providers may be
difficult (or impossible) to locate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is unknown whether or not Bermuda sees transition as child abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage is not recognized.</li>
<li>Bermuda was the first country in the world to repeal a law that
previously allowed gay marriage. This may indicate the general
trajectory of the country regarding LGB rights.</li>
<li>It is likely that Bermuda would consider sex assigned at birth when
determining if a marriage is an opposite-sex marriage.</li>
<li>Married couples may wish to ensure that their legal rights are
protected through alternative means when traveling to Bermuda.
Spouses may be treated as legal strangers and other relatives may
have more rights for decision making in cases of injury or death.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Many in Bermuda do not approve of LGBT people or relationships. Tourist
areas may be more accepting (some LGBT travelers report positive
experiences visiting the island).</p>

<p>Public signs of affection and non-binary presentation may be offensive
to some in Bermuda.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
</section><section id='file-6'><h1 id="toc-12">Canada - Alberta</h1>

<p>Alberta recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary trans people.
I.E. trans women are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary
people are recognized for some purposes. The
non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws for adults are positive and there is
some non-discrimination protection for trans people. However, beyond these
laws, the province has taken negative action against trans youth,
including Canada's most restrictive ban on youth medical care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Alberta non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Alberta.</li>
<li>Anti-trans/anti-gay protests frequently occur, from groups that
connect drag and transgender identity with conspiracy theories.
These protesting groups are connected to the far-right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>International travel should ensure that tickets and passport have
matching gender marker.</p>

<p>Some security screenings are gendered, such as some body scanners, which
may result in a pat-down of trans people that have bodies that don't
match expectations for the body the security staff assumes they have. It
is a traveler's right to have pat downs conducted by the gender of the
passenger's choice, and use different gender screeners for top and
bottom half of the body, should it be necessary.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While trans prisoners can be housed federally in accommodations that
match the person's gender identity, it is unknown whether or not the
province of Alberta does the same.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents.</p>

<p>However, proposed policy, targeted at children in school, have
asserted that parents must approve of name and pronoun changes, even
when used informally, signaling a view of children's rights as
subordinate to parental rights when these rights conflict.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>Alberta has banned HRT, puberty blockers, and some other care for
people under age 16.</li>
<li>However, Alberta has indicated that in Fall of 2024,
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/danielle-smith-1.7101595">provincial policy would outlaw some trans youth medical
care</a></li>
<li>Medical care may be somewhat more difficult for travelers to access
than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
world may.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Trans youth medical care would be banned for children under 16. It is
unknown what impact this may have on custody.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://kings-printer.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=A25P5.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779845767">Alberta Human Rights
Act</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Active, organized anti-trans activity frequently occurs in Alberta, and
Alberta is on the forefront of anti-trans "culture wars" in Canada,
both through protests and through official government action.
While this has not progressed to the degree it has in some USA states,
travelers should be aware and monitor for changes.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans prisoners can be housed in Quebec prisons on the basis of
gender identity rather than sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>In 2023, a trans man was acquitted due to <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/court-tosses-case-against-trans-man-after-inappropriate-and-humiliating-montreal-police-interrogation-1.6314556">transphobic behavior</a>
on the part of Montreal police.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update some documents.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Medical care may be somewhat more difficult for travelers to access
than medical care in some USA states (but likely easier than other
USA states), and may move slower than some providers elsewhere in the
world may.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Active, organized anti-trans activity occurs in Quebec, although this
is less supported than in much of the USA. Much of this anti-trans
activity occurs as "protest" towards Pride events that include youth.</p>

<p>In addition, the government seems poised to limit rights of trans people
in the future. A committee created to "study" trans issues and provide
advice to the government <a href="https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2024/01/quebecs-comite-de-sages-criticized-for-having-no-trans-members/">lacks any trans
members</a>.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan recognizes the gender of binary and non-binary
trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people are
recognized for some purposes. The non-discrimination/anti-harassment laws
are positive and there is non-discrimination protection for trans people.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Saskatchewan non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable

province of Saskatchewan does the same, although there is some
indication it may in some cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are partially recognized, and trans people are generally
recognized on the basis of their gender identity, including the ability
to update their documents, albeit sometimes requiring medical
documentation.</p>

<p>However, parents must approve of name and pronoun changes, even
when used informally, signaling a view of children's rights as
subordinate to parental rights when these rights conflict.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>National LGBT protection law is weak, although some locations (including
Tokyo) have passed stronger local legislation.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/07/12/japan-passes-law-promote-understanding-lgbt-people">national LGBT
law</a>
is relatively weak, although some locations in Japan have passed
stronger laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people can generally use appropriate toilets. Accessible, single-user
bathrooms often exist, and these can be used by people of any gender.
However, at least one trans woman, in 2022, was <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/police-refer-trans-woman-prosecutors-using-womens-bathroom/">referred to
prosecution</a>
for using the women's bathroom.  Thus caution should be exercised.</li>
<li>Public osens (baths) should likely be avoided by trans people who
have not had genital surgeries. In addition, they prohibit people
with tattoos. Private osens and yunessun with bathing suits may be a
viable alternative.</li>

<li>In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers. It is
unknown if these scanners are problematic for trans people.</li>
<li>It is unknown what policies exist around pat-down searches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While in some cases, trans people have been housed according to their
gender, this is likely the exception and trans people should be
expected to be housed in accordance with sex assigned at birth,
particularly if they have not had bottom surgery.</li>
<li>People will be searched in accordance to where they are housed.</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While Mexico does not specifically name trans people in

<p>Mexico does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

change is a work in progress and is at the early stages.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Medical tourism is a large industry in Mexico. Some clinics are
reputable and operate with high standards within regulations, while
others are operating outside of the law and may target medical

written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While Aotearoa / NZ does not specifically name trans people in non-discrimination
law, they appear to be protected under the 1993 Human Rights Act, under
the grounds of "sex" discrimination.</p>

<p>The LGBT community may be referred to as the "rainbow community" here.</p>

<p>Aotearoa / NZ does not have laws against transgender medical care for any age.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>While the 1993 Human Rights Act does not specifically name trans
people, it is believed to protect against anti-trans discrimination
in the same ways it protects against sex discrimination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people can use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. Note
however that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
However, a trans person can use a toilet that best fits their
identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aotearoa / NZ does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Travel into/out-of Aotearoa / NZ will require tickets and documents to
match, including gender.</li>
<li>As of at least Sept. 21, 2023, body scanners are used for travelers
who fail to pass through a metal detector without alarming. These
scanners do not display private parts (just a stylized outline of a
body with areas of concern highlighted by squares), but it does
require the security staff to hit either a pink or blue button
depending on their estimate of the traveler's body (hitting the wrong
one can trigger an alarm in a sensitive area of the body). Travelers
with prosthetics may trigger the alarm, as may be trans people that
are read as a gender that doesn't match stereotypes about their body
parts.  Note that travel on non-jet aircraft does not generally
require screening, so this only applies to jet travel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women can be housed with women, except if they have been
convicted of sexual offenses against women. This is subject to prison
service approval.</li>
<li>Trans men can be housed with men, except if they have been
convicted of sexual offenses against men. This is subject to prison
service approval.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people's prison assignment is based upon prison service
approval.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>People can self-declare their gender, including "M", "F", or "X" on
passports, birth certificates, and other legal documents.  The birth
certificate is commonly used as proof of sex for activities such as
school or prison.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Surgical care for some procedures is unavailable in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Aotearoa / NZ is a country with a variety of different cultures. Some of
these cultures have a long heritage of people who <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/gender-diversity/page-4">do not fit the gender
binary</a>, but others are
more resistant to trans people, in some cases due to the impact of
colonization. Trans people in Aotearoa / NZ face some discrimination, but
tend to face less violence than in the United States.</p>

<p>While there is a history of support for trans people, including the
<a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/georgina-beyer-becomes-first-transgender-woman-elected-parliament">first openly trans minister of parliament in the
world</a>,
recent world-wide "culture wars" have begun making some inroads into New
Zealand. While these are not predominant beliefs, and most residents
appear to reject them, some politicians have begun to <a href="https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/08/17/exclude-trans-women-from-womens-bathrooms-threaten-sports-funding-nz-first/">campaign on
transphobic policies</a>
as of 2023. In addition, anti-trans protesters have been active, fueled
by international anti-trans hate, with <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/08/posie-parker-kellie-jay-keen-minshull-anti-trans-online-hate/">anti-trans hate rhetoric increasing in
2023</a>.
That said, at major hate events, counter-protesters (I.E. people supporting
trans rights) have, thus far (as of September, 2023), outnumbered hate
group members.</p>

<p>In general, more protections exist for trans people in Aotearoa / NZ
than in the United States, particularly around hate speech and
harassment. Like many places, larger cities are said to be more
accepting than some rural places, although trans visitors are generally
unlikely to directly encounter explicit, directed hate in any area of
the country.</p>

<h2>A Note</h2>

<p>An American with limited knowledge of UK law and culture
put this page together. I would be very grateful for those with more
knowledge to improve this page in any and all ways.  While this is geared
for people who might travel to UK.  I prefer that it would
written in an accurate, culturally appropriate way.</p>

<p>UK also has a unique legal system, with some legal responsibilities
locally in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, while others are held
by the UK Parliament.  An attempt to point out these differences, when
relevant is made below.  In addition, the Crown Dependencies and British
Overseas Territories will be discussed in other pages -- this page
covers England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland only.</p>

<p>People visiting the UK with trans youth (under 18) likely should be
cautious with mention of medical transition to medical authorities, as
some have indicated some types of care provided by some providers may be
reportable to child protection agencies.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The UK has non-discrimination law that protects "gender reassignment"
(defined as proposing to undergo, undergoing or having undergone a
process to reassign your sex) in the Equality Act.</p>

<p>UK bans some trans care, notably most use of puberty blockers for anyone
under the age of 18 when used for gender transition. This ban also
applies to out-of-country prescription. It may impact UK citizens
bringing puberty blockers into the country.</p>

<p>Of particular note, sexual activity, even consensual sexual activity,
even including activities such as kissing, may place trans people at risk
if they cannot prove they disclosed their sex assigned at birth to their
partner(s).</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 2010 Equality Act protects "gender reassignment" (including those
who propose, are in the process of undergoing, or have undergone
"gender reassignemnt).  Medical procedures are not necessary for a
person to be covered under this provision.</li>
<li>The law assumes a binary "gender reassignment", and does not
reference non-binary people.</li>
<li>While harassment and discrimination against trans people are
generally prohibited under the law, limited exceptions exist for
some transphobic speech in limited situations and restricting
some single-sex activities and spaces in trans-exclusionary ways. There
is a significant burden placed upon people doing these activities however.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people can use appropriate toilet and locker rooms. Note
however that gender neutral facilities are not required to exist.
However, a trans person can use a toilet that fits their "gender
reassignment" associated gender.</li>
<li>Despite the law, some organizations have enforced anti-trans bathroom
policies against trans women (for example, in October, 2024,
<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/12/butlins-security-guards-suspended-trans-women-dragged-toilets-21783297/">Butlin's dragged 5 trans women and a bystander out of women's
toilet's</a>; Similar incidents have
occurred in locker rooms).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>UK does not have a drag/cross-dressing ban or restriction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Travel into/out-of UK will require tickets and documents to
match, including gender.</li>
<li>In some cases, body scanners are used to screen passengers in the UK,
These scanners do not display private parts (just a stylized outline of a
body with areas of concern highlighted by squares), but it does
require the security staff to hit either a pink or blue button
depending on their estimate of the traveler's body (hitting the wrong
one can trigger an alarm in a sensitive area of the body). Travelers
with prosthetics may trigger the alarm, as may be trans people that
are read as a gender that doesn't match stereotypes about their body
parts.</li>
<li>While some trans travellers have reported that pat downs, when needed
to resolve metal detector or scanner alarms, have been conducted by
security staff that does not match their identified gender. However,
it is often possible to request someone of your identified gender
conduct the screening.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other International Travel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Train travel internationally may follow many of the rules indicated
above for air travel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women who have a penis are almost always required to be housed in
men's prisons.</li>
<li>Trans women, regardless of genital status, who have been convicted of
a sexual offense are almost always required to be housed in men's prisons.</li>
<li>Trans women, regardless of genital status, who have been convicted of
a violent offense are almost always required to be housed in men's prisons.</li>
<li>For trans prisoners not covered by the above requirements to be
housed in men's prisons, the prison system may or may not respect the
prisoner's own safety concerns when making housing decisions.</li>
<li>Trans women who are not allowed to be housed in a women's prison may
be housed in a "specialist unit."</li>
<li>The prison service does not recognize non-binary identity.</li>
<li>Trans prisoners have reported misgendering and lack of appropriate
hygiene items when housed according to assignment at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Binary trans people can change their gender identification on passports and
driver's licenses after meeting certain requirements. Additional
requirements are required to have your identified gender listed on
birth, death, or marriage documents. Note that UK does not recognize
updated gender markers from most places which allow "self-ID" for the
purposes of birth, death, or marriage documents.</p>

<p>Non-binary gender is not recognized in the UK.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/868/pdfs/uksi_20240868_en.pdf">UK
law</a>
bans transition-related puberty blockers in most cases for people under 18.
This may impact UK citizens bringing puberty blockers from overseas, even
with a valid overseas prescription. Overseas prescribers will not be able
to issue prescriptions to be filled in the UK.</li>
<li>Trans patients will be ineligible to be treated on single-sex wards
that don't match their "biological sex" (AKA sex assigned at birth)
if <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-68923861">proposed changes to the NHS constitution are
approved</a> (updated May 4,
2024).</li>
<li>NHS clinics typically refer trans-related medical patients to
specialty units. These units can have extremely long wait times (many
years).</li>
<li>Hormone therapy is generally not available to youth (under 18) at NHS-run
clinics.</li>
<li>Private trans care is available in the UK, but this will generally
exclude puberty blockers.</li>
<li>Youth trans care is highly contested in the UK and is an area that is
seeing a shift away from affirming the gender of trans youth. While
youth care is available, parents should be aware of this and ensure
any health needs of their children can be met while visiting UK.</li>
<li>Some private internet websites that provide HRT are <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-delists-sites-providing-diy-hormone-therapy-at-behest-of-uk-government/">blocked in the
UK</a>.
The UK appears to be targeting some internet-providers. As of now,
the blocking has only impacted sites that prescribe HRT without
prescriptions, but some UK government officials have indicated a
desire to prohibit online prescribing in the future (however, it
remains legal as of May, 2024).</li>
<li>Travelers should ensure they follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/take-medicine-in-or-out-uk">drug importation rules of the
UK</a>.  Specifically,
non-UK residents should bring a letter that includes your name, dates
of travel, a list of medications, dosages of all medications, and the
signature of the prescriber. Note that you cannot bring more than 3
months of medication. Note that rules for UK residents differ and may
be more strict.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>UK health providers may<a href="https://www.wearequeeraf.com/nhs-england-to-tell-transgender-children-to-medically-detransition-or-face-safeguarding-referrals/">report use of hormones or puberty blockers by
minors</a>
to child protection agencies when these are prescribed from
"overseas" or "unregulated" providers.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sexual Activity</h2>

<ul>
<li>"Deception as to sex" is an offense in the UK, and the Crown
Prosecution Service has
<a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/rape-and-sexual-offences-chapter-6-consent#a11">guidance</a>
that makes sexual activity without disclosing birth sex illegal.
Sexual activity is broadly defined and may include things not
considered sex in other countries (such as, possibly, kissing).
This guidance also applies to people with a Gender Recognition
Certificate (GRC): sex without disclosing birth sex, even for a GRC
and who has had bottom surgery may be prosecuted.</li>
<li>Trans people engaging in any sort of physical intimacy (including
even some forms while clothed) should consider if they may want to
ensure they have documentation of disclosing their birth sex, to
prevent a possible prosecution by someone who later has regrets or
wants revenge.</li>
<li>It is likely this places trans people participating in some forms of
the underground sex economy at high risk of prosecution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>UK, like many countries, is diverse and different areas may be more or
less accepting of gender variation. However, trans people are legally
protected and generally safe. However, in some cases harassment or even
violent attack (typically unarmed or knife attacks) may occur.  Unlike the
US, gun crime is rare in the UK, which provides some safety compared to the
US.</p>

<p>Knife crime against trans people sometimes occurs in the UK. For
instance, three boys <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/three-boys-arrested-in-stockton-after-transgender-woman-attacked-13163073">stabbed a trans
woman</a>
in Cleveland in July, 2024.</p>

<p>There is a high awareness of the existence of trans persons in UK, due
to extensive (often transphobic) media coverage. This may prime some
people to engage in transphobia towards trans people. That said,
violence or harassment on the basis of legally protected characteristics
("gender reassignment") is against the law in the UK.  While transphobic
beliefs are not particularly widespread, some of the views are very
loudly expressed, through well-funded transphobic media organizations.</p>

<p>Alabama has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

<p>Alabama does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Alabama non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, namely
Birmingham and Montevallo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools,
including public universities and university-run programs, such as
medical organizations that are part of public universities. The
public university provision takes effect on October 1, 2024.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Alabama.</li>
<li>Alabama has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Alabama does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women would typically be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men would typically be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.  The limited recognition of trans people in
the state often requires proof of surgery.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 19 (including 18-year-olds) has passed and became law.</li>
<li>Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are criminalized.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
beliefs.</li>
<li>In an abortion case, the Attorney General has indicated that
assisting someone with transportation out-of-state for abortion could
be <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23932753-yellowhammer-fund-et-al-v-steve-marshall-and-west-alabama-womens-center-et-al-v-steve-marshall">considered
conspiracy</a>.
That law is similar to the anti-trans youth healthcare ban, thus people
should be aware that when visiting Alabama, many actions that don't
involve Alabama may be considered criminal conspiracy by the head law
enforcement officer in the state.</li>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools,
including public universities and university-run programs, such as
medical organizations that are part of public universities.  The public
university provision takes effect on October 1, 2024.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Alabama due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
for youth and teens (note this applies to people who are 18-years-old
as the age of majority in Alabama is 19) is illegal, in a law entitled
the "Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act."  This law
is blocked from enforcement (for the puberty blocker and hormone
therapy aspects) by court while litigation proceeds, but shows the
state's view of this care.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) up to grade 5 in schools. It
also bans much of cultural-studies curriculum (gender studies, Black studies,
etc) at public universities under 2024 SB129.</p>

<p>Politicians at the state and national level have weighed in on the idea
that trans people should not be employed anywhere children are present,
with <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/03/right-wing-officials-gang-up-to-lob-vicious-attacks-on-a-single-transgender-space-camp-employee/">Alabama's Senators and
others</a>
expressing that a Space Camp employee who is trans should be fired. Note
that there is no allegation of wrongdoing, simply anger that the
employee is trans.  While visitors are not directly impacted by this,
they should be aware of the public, high-profile anti-trans hate being
spread by powerful government officials, and that can impact
interactions and encounters in Alabama.</p>

<p>Birmingham has been called out as welcoming by a contributor ("hub of
all queerness"), and may be more welcoming than some other places.
Likewise, Mobile has also been noted for having Decadence, the first
Mardi Gras parade, the Prancing Elites, has the Fruit Loop which
includes one of the only lesbian bars in the country, and politicians and
organizations who have supported gay people historically.  That said,
municipalities have limited power and cannot override state laws.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>American Samoa does have a history of being supportive of Fa'afafine
people, who are sometimes seen as a third gender.  After colonization,

<p>California recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.</p>

<p>California is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in California non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in California.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>State prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
housing decisions, but may or may not comply with requests of
prisoners.</li>
<li>City and county jail policies are not covered by the state law.</li>
<li>Even where good policies exist, they usually mirror federal guidance
which says gender identity must be taken into consideration for
housing decisions. However, in practice this consideration can matter
very little and correctional officers will value their own biases
more than the trans person's gender identity.</li>
<li>Trans women in women's state prisons <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11964027/california-prisons-fail-to-uphold-transgender-rights-despite-state-law">report abuse, rape, and risk of
violence</a>,
despite the law.</li>
<li>San Diego is known to inappropriately house trans prisoners. For instance,
in 2020, a trans woman placed in male jail in San Diego was <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-news/transgender-woman-recalls-beating-in-san-diego-county-jail">beaten badly
by male inmates</a>.</li>
<li>Los Angeles is known to inappropriately house trans prisoners. In
2023, a trans man was <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cant-die-video-shows-trans-100029056.html">housed in women's jail</a>
after being required to show his genitals to a female jailer.</li>
<li>Riverside County is known to house trans women inappropriately, and
is <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2023/08/28/lawsuit-transgender-inmate-killed-after-getting-sex-offender-cellmate/70700836007/">being
sued</a>
by the family of a trans inmate who was killed by her violent, cis
male cellmate, possibly with the cooperation of jail staff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in California.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>California will not cooperate with other states who seek information
about patients receiving care in California for medical transition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>California has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in California</li>
<li>California will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While California will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in California via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions. For instance, in December, 2024,
in Riverside, a cis Black woman was chased out of a bathroom for being
in the "wrong" bathroom, and a trans woman who was part of a group
protesting anti-trans hate was physically attacked.</p>

<p>Despite California's reputation as LGBT friendly, different localities
may have different attitudes towards trans people. For instance, Calexico,
in 2024, <a href="https://www.metroweekly.com/2024/04/california-mayor-recalled-after-coming-out-as-transgender/">recalled their
mayor</a>
after their mayor came out as transgender. The recall campaign was
aggressively transphobic, although it officially claimed to be about
progressive politics.</p>

<p>However, much of California is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the major cities where many people are visibly trans. That said, attacks
still can and do occur in California, particularly around school board
meetings discussing LGBT policies and schools teaching LGBT schools. For
instance, LGBT supporters at Saticoy Elementary in North Hollywood were
attacked by anti-LGBT protesters (who also used anti-Semitic language),
leaving one LGBT supporter unresponsive during the protest <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/saticoy-elementary-school-pride-assembly-protest-erupts-in-violence">on June 2,
2023</a>.
Rural areas may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some
jurisdictions outside of the major metro areas have attempted to restrict
the rights of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries. For
instance, an elected official uses his social media platform to <a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/local/shasta-county-office-of-education-board-member-faces-possible-censure">misgender a trans
constituent</a>
Murrieta Valley School District <a href="https://www.advocate.com/education/murrieta-valley-outing-transgender-students">approved transphobic
policies</a>,
and Chino Valley School District has approved anti-LGBT policies (which were
blocked by a court, but which was rewritten to <a href="https://edsource.org/2024/chino-valley-revamps-parental-notification-policy-lgbtq-allies-fear-legal-escalation/707444">bypass the court order</a>
and allow continued discrimination).  Thus it is important to recognize that
California is not unified and does not have a single view of trans people.</p>

<p>Even cities that proclaim themselves a safe city for trans people, trans
people such as Sacramento, see some attacks, sach as a March 2024
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9wpla-5krE">physical attack on trans
people</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, beyond political events and education, other violence has
occurred in California, sometimes not being restricted to the queer
community, but also impacting allies, such as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/20/1194932544/lauri-carleton-california-store-owner-killed-pride-flag-lgbtq">murder of a
66-year-old mother of nine because the shooter disliked her pride
flag</a>
that she was flying at her shop in support of the LGBT community. Thus,
like in most of the USA, care should be taken when displaying visible
symbols of the LGBT community.</p>

<p>Colorado recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.</p>

<p>Colorado is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Colorado non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
<li>In 2023, a law was passed that requires all government buildings with
single-user bathrooms must sign them gender-neutrally as of July 1,
2024 and newly-built government buildings must have at least one neutral
restroom per floor. After July 1, 2025, all government buildings must
have one per floor. Note that this includes colleges and universities
but not K12 schools.</li>
<li>Denver and Boulder have ordinances requiring single-user bathrooms to
be signed as gender neutral.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Colorado.</li>
<li>Drag shows in Colorado, particularly G-rated shows open to all ages,
have been the target of armed protests, intimidation, and threats. In
general, law enforcement has sided with the extremists, citing freedom
of speech and Colorado's open carry laws, and do not generally
enforce laws against implied violent threats and intimidation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While most jails/prisons have regulations that, in theory, would
consider gender identity in housing decisions, these regulations are
often ignored and trans people are often housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Colorado.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition is
still in-complete in Colorado.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Colorado will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Colorado for medical transition.</li>
<li>Some providers (notably Children's Hospital) have cut back on
transition care, including <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/18/childrens-hospital-colorado-transgender-surgery/?share=se0slhdorisewirvhdgy">cutting back on care for people over
age 18</a>.
While the stated reason is to ensure they have capacity for children
under 18, the obvious reason is so they can deny that surgeries are
being done at Children's Hospital (since they do not do surgeries for
anyone under 18, cutting off 18+ people, despite 18+ people routinely
getting care at Children's for other needs, this eliminated all
surgeries).</li>
<li>Colorado has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Colorado</li>
<li>Colorado will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Colorado has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related

<li>Colorado will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, much of Colorado is considered reasonably safe, particularly
the Denver/Boulder metro area where many people are visibly trans. That
said, attacks still can and do occur in Colorado.  Rural areas
may be more swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric, and some jurisdictions
outside of the Denver/Boulder metro have attempted to restrict the rights
of trans people, particularly in schools and libraries.  In addition,
some suburbs in the Denver metro area have shown willingness to attempt
to restrict LGBT representation (Douglas County in particular, although
Jefferson County has also recently, as of August 10, 2023, begun to
implement new transphobic policies in school systems, such as
restricting teachers from asking for pronouns). Thus travelers should be
aware that "near Denver" is not necessarily as supportive as Denver.</p>

<p>In addition, LGBT people are victims of hate crimes in Colorado. For
instance, in Aurora, an otherwise inclusive city, a man <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/aurora-police-seek-2-men-for-alleged-hate-crime-attack/">alleges he was
attacked for his sexual
orientation</a>
on Feb. 7, 2024.</p>

<p>LGBT events in Colorado, particularly G-rated drag shows open to all ages,
have been the target of armed right-wing extremists using intimidation and
threats. In general, law enforcement has sided with the extremists, citing
freedom of speech and Colorado's open carry laws, and do not generally
enforce laws against implied violent threats and intimidation. Groups
present at these events include hate groups such as the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys">Proud
Boys</a>
and the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6KunBhDxARIsAKFUGs_F9z9CLMCHyB2fHvrR4JErXRFpIfYQ3PPt-5pRdyBFShbYq7SItdgaApsCEALw_wcB">Patriot
Front</a>.
Targeting tends to focus on small-scale events, such as small town pride
events and drag queen storytimes, while the larger events are largely
free of intimidation. Most recently, this targeting occurred at Douglas
County Pride on August 26, 2023. Drag storytimes have also received bomb
threats, such as at the Lafayette Public Library on Sept. 30, 2023.
An anti-LGBT group protested Fountain's October 2023 pride event, which
included attempts to provoke LGBT-friendly counter-protesters into
violence.</p>

<p>One community, Enfield, has <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/connecticut-pride-flag-ban-isis">banned the Pride

<p>HRC and Equality Florida, LGBT advocacy groups, have issued an advisory travel
warning for the State of Florida.  In addition, both LULAC and NAACP
have also issued advisories.  Finally, SPARTA, a transgender military
advocacy group has also issued a duty assignment warning for Florida.</p>

<p>Florida has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>People visiting Florida, including connecting to outbound flights and/or
cruises, should be aware of the laws that may apply to them.</p>

<p>Florida does criminalize trans care for children, and elected officials
in both the executive and legislative branch consider transition of
children (or even exposure to transgender information) to either be
child abuse or to be "grooming" for child abuse. This could have custody
implications for families with children and transgender family members,
should children enter Florida's jurisdiction, although it is not yet (or
proposed to be under pending legislation) legally considered child
abuse.  Florida's youth care ban also allows the Florida courts to have
emergency jurisdiction over a child if "it is necessary in an emergency
to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or is
threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or
procedures," similar to how the courts have jurisdiction over abuse.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some Florida municipalities do have non-discrimination laws that
include trans people.</li>
<li>Jacksonville's non-discrimination law is being <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/courts/2023/02/24/transgender-debate-sparks-catholic-store-lawsuit-over-jacksonville-hro/69933481007/">challenged by
Alliance Defending Freedom</a> who seeks to allow businesses to
require misgendering of customers, on the basis of religious
owners of a for-profit corporation.</li>
<li>Public school (K12) employees are required to use pronouns and titles
associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth. This is being
<a href="https://fox17.com/news/nation-world/florida-state-federal-lawsuits-mother-minors-transgender-hormone-therapy-puberty-blockers-treatment-lgbt-discrimination-lawyers-teachers-personal-pronoun-title-law-republican-legislature-gov-ron-desantis-social-conservatives-issues">challenged in court by teachers impacted by this

One teacher has obtained a <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/florida-has-a-1st-amendment-problem">preliminary
injunction</a>
allowing her to use her pronouns in school, but this ruling only
applies to this one teacher. Note that this preliminary injunction
does not prevent students from misgendering her.</li>
<li>State officials have directed schools to <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/04/25/four-states-to-ignore-new-title-ix-rules-protecting-trans-students/">ignore Title IX
regulations</a>
(as of April 25, 2024) regarding non-discrimination against trans people.</li>
<li>Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
these organizations. However (information current on October 11,
2023), a court is preventing the state from enforcing the drag ban.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Florida.</li>
<li>There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies,
schools, universities, etc.</li>
<li>The bathroom law will apply to airports and cruise ports, in addition
to other government facilities. It also applies to highway rest
areas, which are state owned.</li>
<li>Florida has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Trans women are being challenged for using bathrooms not covered by
the Florida law, including federal facilities <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/florida-veteran-transgender-bathroom">such as the
VA</a>,
even before the Florida law goes into effect. The challenges are often
other bathroom users objecting to the presence of trans women in the
bathroom, after which business/organization staff, security, or police
force the trans person to leave. This is regardless of the user's legal
identification, length of time on HRT, etc.</li>
<li>Visitors to schools, such as parents and family members, will be
covered by the educational laws and be required to be misgendered by
school staff and forced to use improper bathrooms.</li>
<li>The bathroom law is <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/09/29/transgender-nonbinary-group-sues-florida-in-federal-court-over-new-bathroom-restrictions/">being challenged in
court</a>
as of September 30, 2023.</li>
<li>The Florida Dept. of Education has also <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20680/urlt/8-2.pdf">enacted
rules</a>
to ban trans people from bathrooms and locker rooms at private
colleges and universities.</li>
<li>An RV park discriminated against a trans woman, telling her she
needed to "dress like a man" and "act like a man" or face eviction.
However, the federal HUD agency reached a settlement with the RV park
requiring them to stop discriminating and pay the trans woman and her
family a <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_22_160">$45,000
settlement</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Florida has shown willingness to conduct criminal investigations into
drag performances where minors were present.</li>
<li>Florida has a "protection of children" law that bans "lewd conduct"
and similar activities outside of venues such as strip clubs that are
licensed for the purpose and only permit adults. This has been
labeled a drag ban, and depending on how courts interpret various
phrases may or may not actually be one. However, a court case, as of
June 11, 2024, prevents the state from enforcing this law.</li>
<li>Some businesses and LGBT organizations have canceled events that
might involve drag or trans people participating, due to the
possibility of the "protection of children" law being used against
these organizations. However, see the above bullet point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cruise / Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a "bathroom law" in Florida.  It makes it a crime to use a
bathroom in government facilities (city, county, or state government)
not associated with your assigned sex at birth, if anyone objects
to your presence and you refused to immediately leave. This also
covers health care facilities, massage parlors, jails, pharmacies, etc.</li>
<li>This law would apply to airport and cruise port bathrooms, so trans people
and families should use caution connecting through Florida airports
and cruise ports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women must be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men must be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are housed according to sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Local jails have housed at least one cis woman in men's jail after
mistaking her for a trans woman.</li>
<li>As public funds cannot be used for transition care, trans prisoners
will not have access to trans-related medical care.</li>
<li>Prisoners are subject to humiliating naked exams by people of the
wrong gender and sometimes forced detransition (haircuts, prevention
of use of gender-appropriate garments, forced conversion therapy,
drugging, etc).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>While a non-binary birth certificate (perhaps only a single one) has
been issued, Florida does not generally recognize non-binary gender.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.  Florida does not permit trans people to
have driver's licenses that reflect an accurate gender marker.</p>

<p>Florida law defines sex largely consistent with sex assigned at birth
for a large number of interactions trans travelers may have. Birth
certificates, IDs, genital configurations, etc, will not take priority
over sex assigned at birth.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults, but with significant
restrictions that are, in-practice, a ban on trans healthcare, and
require misleading (and medically inaccurate) "informed consent"
forms, restrict what providers can provide the care unnecessarily,
and put in place restrictions that will prevent many providers who
are otherwise qualified under the law from taking the legal risk of
providing care.  Should any care providers continue to provide this
care, there will be long waiting lists.  This is updated on August
24, 2024.</li>
<li>Trans medical care for youth is illegal (as of August 26, 2024).
This includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny most care on the basis of their religious
or ethical beliefs (emergency care is required to be provided).</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in medicine were blocked in Florida
due to the <a href="https://genderanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/047127228576.pdf">Florida v. Health and Human
Services</a>
preliminary injunction on July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have
many of the federal protections on the basis of sex when obtaining
medical care in this state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is a law against trans surgical care for youth in Florida.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>HRC and Equity Florida have issued a joint
<a href="https://floridatraveladvisory.com/">travel warning</a>
for the State of Florida due to anti-LGBT legislation.  The
<a href="https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida">NAACP</a>,
<a href="https://lulac.org/news/pr/LULACS_HISTORIC_WARNING_AGAINST_LATINOS_TRAVELING_TO_FLORIDA_IS_A_REMINDER_OF_ARIZONA_FOLLOWING_SB1070/">LULAC</a>
(a Latino advocacy organization), the
<a href="https://floridatraveladvisory.com/">Florida Immigrant Commission</a>, and
<a href="https://spartapride.org/duty-assignment-warning-issued-for-florida/">SPARTA</a>
(a transgender service member advocacy organization)
have also done so, for state-sponsored attacks against their
constituents' human rights.</p>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools.  Local officials have
broadly applied this law, including using the law as justification for
censoring <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/01/seminole-schools-offer-to-remove-lgbtq-pages-from-high-school-yearbook/?fbclid=IwAR0h7CGbTNdU8oXtyBdg872dGf0E9VcGFln6h2m8TafunxsZ_FJNaVKXpas">student speech</a>.</p>

<p>Some state officials consider exposure of children to sexual orientation or
gender identity information to be "grooming," I.E. something done in
preparation to abuse a child. Thus trans people in the presence of
children may be at risk of state action and/or hostile interactions with
others who believe that your presence may be a prelude to child abuse.
The "groomer" insult towards trans people originated in Florida.</p>

<p>Florida has taken moves to <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/06/16/fdle-cracks-down-on-transgender-rights-protesters-2-months-after-panty-toss/">arrest peaceful
protesters</a>
months after protests against government officials. These protesters
were involved in LGBT, immigrant, civil rights, and reproductive justice
protests at government buildings. They did not damage property or use
violence. Those arrested included current and former government
officials.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Recent attacks on trans girls/women have been reported in (note links
discuss violent crimes against trans people)
<a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/man-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-transgender-woman-in-miami-bar/">bathrooms</a>,
<a href="https://www.advocate.com/crime/2022/8/10/trans-teen-victim-vicious-anti-lgbtq-assault-second-time">residential
areas</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article290303974.html">airports</a> (including misgendering by police of victim),
as well as by
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jenny-deleon-florida-hillsborough-county-sheriff-choking_n_634ee621e4b0e376dc114d95">police officers</a>.
In addition, at least one trans person has recently been
<a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/08/11/brevard-public-schools-dismiss-reports-transgender-school-assault/10297179002/">wrongfully accused</a>
of sexually assaulting others in bathrooms by Florida politicians.
Another trans person was <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/transgender-woman-severely-beaten-after-lgbtq-event-in-miami-18469390">attacked while leaving a Miami LGBT
event</a>.</p>

<p>Fernandina Beach's city council, like other cities, passed a 2023
proclamation recognition Transgender Day of Remembrance.  However the
mayor and some city council members claimed the proclamation was
"political" and <a href="https://www.fbnewsleader.com/index.php/local-newsletter/mayor-steps-away-transgender-recognition">refused to support
it</a>.</p>

<p>That said, locals have indicated larger cities tend to be more inclusive
than rural areas, and southern Florida more inclusive than northern
Florida.  One city, Lake Worth Beach, has passed <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/lake-worth-beach-sanctuary-city-lgbtq-community-floridas-first-gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender-9-6-2023">a sanctuary
resolution</a>,
although that resolution will have limited power due to state law and
the ability and willingness of the state to remove local prosecutors who
do not enforce discriminatory state laws.</p>

<li>Medical care for transgender children is restricted. While puberty
blockers are legal, hormone therapy and surgery are illegal.</li>
<li>The youth healthcare ban is being <a href="https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/press-release-georgia-parents-seek-emergency-court-order-blocking-anti-transgender">challenged in
court</a>.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Georgia due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on

</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Georgia has few protections for trans people, and trans children may be
at particular risk if using hormone replacement therapy.</p>

<p>A "Don't say gay" bill <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB88/id/2679859">banning discussion of student's sexual
orientation, student's gender identity, or sexual education
topics</a> without written
parental permission in schools until Age 16 has been re-introduced during an
out-of-session committee meeting in August, 2023. While this is not law,
visitors who may be presenting material in Georgia schools should keep
track of this law. The proposed, but not passed, bill also requires student
names to be maintained under their initial enrollment name, reflecting a
possible belief by legislatures that other types of name changes (such
as changing a last name to avoid association with an abuser) are not
appropriate for children.</p>

<p>A fire at a trans healthcare clinic <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/gender-care-clinic-arson-georgia">was caused by arson and is being
investigated as a hate
crime</a>.
The clinic, in Decatur, a progressive, generally LGBT-friendly city,
provides services to the trans community.  This indicates that violent
anti-trans activity may target visible trans organizations.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, there are visible LGBT communities in some cities (Atlanta,
Savannah) which may have some degree of safety.  This is
in-spite of the law, not because of the law. Atlanta's leaders, in particular,
has given <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/atlanta-mayor-dickens-transgender-community-funding">public support to trans
people</a></p>

<p>Police departments in Georgia may inaccurately gender crime victims (for
instance, <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/deputies-identify-23-year-old-found-shot-death-empty-parking-lot/BXOK2FMBQZHIXDLGGGWLAPKYTA/">Macon Police misgendered a trans woman murder

<li>Guam has some policies in line with the federal PREA, although it is

<p>Guam does have a history of being supportive of who today are called LGBT people,
pre-colonization. However, after colonization, laws were passed (and
since repealed) that made some LGBT activities illegal.  The indigenous
history of acceptance still has strands that survived colonization and
people may find Guam somewhat accepting, despite lack of public
accommodations or other formal laws protecting trans people.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Hawaii recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or
agencies may not fully recognize these changes.</p>

<p>Hawaii does not appear to place child custody at risk.</p>

<p>Note that colonization disrupted Hawaiian culture significantly,
significantly impacting Māhū, or "people in the middle," who today
sometimes (but not always) also refer to themselves as trans.  Many
indigenous Hawaiians view tourism today as continuing the colonization
of Hawaii and ask tourists without connections to indigenous Hawaii
to plan vacations to places other than Hawaii, because of the harm that
will be done by this continuing form of colonization.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Hawaii non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>

<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex

<li>News reports indicate that gender affirming care is sub-par or

</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change driver's licenses but not
birth certificates.</p>

<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>

<p>However, much of Hawaii is considered reasonably safe. Indigenous
Hawaiians culture recognized people who were Māhū or "in the middle."
As a result, there is some familiarity with non-cis gender expression.
However, due to the impact of Christianity and colonialism, prejudice
exists both within and outside of indigenous culture in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Idaho has negative laws towards trans people. These laws may, in some
cases, impact travelers.  In particular, medical professionals,
government employees, and people working for public colleges and
universities are allowed to discriminate.  There are also laws that
can be interpreted to limit bathroom access for trans people.</p>

<p>Idaho does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Idaho non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Idaho allows all levels of government employees and public school
employees (including higher education employees) to refuse to
recognize names other than legal names. This also allows these
same people to willingly misgender trans people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>According to law, trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers
associated with their sex assigned at birth when using some
bathrooms/showers in schools. However, this is <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/08/10/u-s-district-court-temporarily-blocks-enforcement-of-idaho-transgender-bathroom-law/">being
challenged</a> in
court and a temporary restraining order against this law, thus
bathroom/shower access in schools is temporarily allowed in Idaho, as
of August 10, 2023.  Note however that this only blocks this <em>state</em>
law, and does not block any local school policies that are discriminatory,
as those aren't at issue in the lawsuit.</li>
<li>Enforcement of school bathroom regulations is unclear. But see above,
as the law is temporarily stayed.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Idaho.</li>
<li>Idaho has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Idaho has a law that prevents all levels of government from enforcing
any bathroom non-discrimination laws upon businesses and organizations
that contract with government. (Example: homeless shelters,
businesses that contract with the state, private schools that get
state money, etc).</li>
<li>Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
but it is unclear how that is reconciled with state law.</li>
<li>Idaho allows all levels of government employees and public school employees
(including higher education employees) to refuse to recognize names
other than legal names. This also allows these same people to willingly
misgender trans people. This may affect some public accommodations and
tourist attractions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Currently, no ban on drag performance</li>

<li>Trans women are usually housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men are usually housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
<li>While the state lost a lawsuit and was required to provide gender
confirmation surgery to a prisoner, it should be expected that
medical care will be sub-par. The state also aggressively fought to
deny care, and would be expected to do so in the future.</li>
<li>Therapists, who may be gatekeepers for trans medicine in prison
systems, can use 2024 S1352 to refuse to provide trans-related
care.</li>
<li>Idaho allows all government employees, including law enforcement,
jail, and prison employees at all levels of government to refuse to
recognize names other than legal names.  This also allows those employees
to misgender trans employees and others.  This will allow those working
in jails and prisons this right to discrimination.</li>

the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Illinois recognizes the gender of binary trans people. I.E. trans women
are considered women, trans men are men. However, while non-binary people
lack some recognition (for instance, until 2024, will be unable to get
an "X" marker on their license), most laws are positive and there is
non-discrimination protection for trans people.</p>

<p>Illinois is a "sanctuary state" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in Illinois non-discrimination laws.</li>
<li>Illinois has a religious freedom law that may provide religious exemptions
to non-discrimination law in some limited circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans prisoners have typically been housed based on sex assigned at
birth, rather than gender, denied medical care, and mistreated by
guards. Some <a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/transgender-prison-idoc/">are
suing the state</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no legal definition of male/female in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
However, non-binary recognition is still in-complete in Illinois.
For example, "X" gender markers are not available on driver's licenses
in Illinois due to <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/25/20832644/pritzker-approves-non-binary-state-id-cards-drivers-licenses">bureaucratic reasons</a>
(the law allows this but the
company the state's current contract is with does not allow it).</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Illinois will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Illinois for medical transition.</li>
<li>There is a religious exemption law that applies to limited medical
situations in Illinois.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Illinois has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Illinois</li>
<li>Illinois will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Illinois will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Illinois via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media

are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

<p>Indiana does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Indiana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
Indianapolis-Marion County.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in Indiana.</li>
<li>Indiana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of

ACLU</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>State identification can be changed. Some identification may require a
court order, however, and some courts have proven resistant to changing
identification. In addition, for birth certificates, different appeals
courts have reached <a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judicial-uncertainty-continues-over-birth-certificate-changes-for-transgender-hoosiers/article_e2032d1e-ef6d-11ed-8865-7bb25f459685.html">different

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 18 has passed and became law.</li>
<li>Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
law applies only to medical providers.</li>
<li>The state government has <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/01/indiana-ag-enlists-dc-firm-to-investigate-transgender-care-providers/71770234007/">engaged a conservative law
firm</a>
to sue providers for not disclosing risks of trans medical care. This
is not being done to protect parents, but rather to intimidate
providers and restrict care.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
beliefs.</li>
<li>Conversion therapy is not banned and municipalities are banned from
enacting rules banning conversion therapy.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Indiana due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
for children is illegal.  This ban shows the state's view of this care.</li>
<li>The Indiana Attorney General has stated, to hospitals providing youth
care, that trans care is child abuse. While it remains legal (except
for surgery) for trans youth, the state has made clear statements on
how they view this care and people who provide it.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>

<p>Iowa has several negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans visitors.</p>

<p>Iowa does outlaw some medical trans care for children, but
does not generally criminalize such care, thus it appears that parents
visiting with trans children will not risk custody.</p>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade six in schools.</p>

<p>Essex, a small town near Shanandooah, has <a href="https://www.kmaland.com/news/aclu-demands-shenandoah-prides-inclusion-in-essex-parade/article_8c16ccb0-4a64-11ee-85be-9b933dd52bdd.html">banned an LGBT
organization</a>
from participating in a city parade, saying that the parade "will not be
used for and will not allow sexual identification or sexual orientation
agendas for, or against, to be promoted." This may indicate predominant
(or at least significant) attitudes towards LGBT people.</p>

<p>In 2023, Iowa City, University of Iowa police have <a href="https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2024/02/01/charges-against-seven-trans-protesters-spark-uproar-in-johnson-county-chloe-cole/72426978007/">targeted transgender
protesters</a>
who protested against an anti-trans speaker, while not charging any
cisgender protesters.  This has drawn condemnation from the city's
board of supervisors and Human Rights Commissioner. Those engaging in
protests should be aware of this.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Kansas places trans people at risk by not recognizing any gender other
than sex assigned at birth, regardless of legal documentation changes in
Kansas or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Trans travelers should use extreme caution in Kansas due to 2023 SB180 (The
badly named "Women's Bill of Rights"). Kansas requires all state
agencies to treat all trans women as men, all trans men as women, and
all non-binary people on the basis of their sex assigned at birth. This
has wide-ranging implications, such as improper incarceration, bathroom
access, identifications, etc.</p>

<p>Kansas does not appear to place child custody at risk.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kansas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>The State is required under 2023 SB180 to discriminate against trans
people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because of Kansas's law defining sex legally (note that the law does
not mention bathrooms directly), it may be interpreted by courts, in
combination with other laws, to ban trans people from appropriate
bathrooms. This is the opinion held by the Attorney General, so it is
likely to be followed by state agencies.</li>
<li>Trans women are required to use male facilities such
as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.</li>
<li>Trans men are required to use women's facilities such
as bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, homeless accommodations, etc.</li>
<li>Non-binary people are required to use facilities
based on sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Some cities have protections against gender-identity discrimination,
but the state law will override many of these protections.</li>
<li>At least one religious-based shelter enforces a rule which bans any
trans person <a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/local/2023/09/14/topeka-homeless-shelter-explains-policy-for-transgender-and-nonbinary-residents/70826076007/">which makes residents
"uncomfortable"</a>.
This has been enforced against non-binary AFAB people in a women's
shelter who were criticized for wearing boxers and being seen "with a
bulge" (the person involved did not wear a packer at the shelter).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is unknown how this would be enforced, beyond where the state has the
power to impose gender determination on people. It is likely that, for
instance, a trans woman using a women's bathroom could be charged with
other crimes that do carry a penalty on the basis that the state
prohibits her from being in the space.</p>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Currently, no ban on drag performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is illegal to use a bathroom that does not match your sex
assigned at birth in Kansas airports (note that Kansas City
Airport - MCI - is in Missouri, not Kansas, and thus this law does
not apply to the Kansas City Airport)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are required to be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are required to be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
<li>The prison system is accused of particularly <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article284628270.html">egregious discrimination</a>
against a trans prison worker. This indicates that the state may
be extremely harsh towards trans inmates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is not possible to change the sex on your birth certificate or
driver's license in Kansas.</li>
<li>sex = "biological sex, either male or female, at birth"</li>
<li>female = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
to produce ova"</li>
<li>male = "individual whose biological reproductive system is developed
to fertilize the ova of a female"</li>
<li>woman = "human females"</li>
<li>girl = "human females"</li>
<li>man = "human male"</li>
<li>boy = "human male"</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people who are "born with a medically verifiable diagnosis of
'disorder/differences in sex development'" should be considered disabled
and provided accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

<p>The Attorney General has issued an opinion requiring state agencies to
re-issue driver's licenses and birth certificates where they have been
changed because a person is transgender. The re-issued licenses and
certificates would indicate the sex assigned at birth. The Governor
disagrees with this interpretation and has made some indications
(but not official executive orders) that she will direct agencies to
continue to not re-issue documents with sex assigned at birth, but a
state court thus far has agreed with the attorney general, overruling
the Governor (as of July 10, 2023).</p>

<p>Note that these laws while targeting trans people also place gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Kansas due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Some communities may be more welcoming than others. For instance,
Lawrence was indicated as a welcoming city and has passed an ordinance
that <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2023/07/18/lawrencecitycomm-approves-ord9999/">prohibits collecting sex assigned at
birth</a>
or otherwise cooperating with 2023 SB180.</p>

<p>Bathroom access is a significant issue in Kansas.  Already, in May
2023, the same month the trans-exclusionary definition of sex was
enacted, a cis woman in a public library who was assisting her
non-verbal son use the bathroom was
<a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/05/23/amid-anti-trans-law-kansas-woman-son-asked-to-leave-library-restroom/70245966007/">kicked out of the women's bathroom</a>,
which she believes is connected to SB180 (prior to the passage of SB180,
they had used the bathroom for years). The son's presence was also
objected to by another bathroom user in addition to library staff,
showing that this policing bathrooms is on the mind of Kansas citizens.
Note that in addition to these actions, these laws while targeting trans
people also place gender non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive
questioning and state action.</p>

<p>Beyond bathrooms, hostility against rainbow symbols, even rainbow
symbols that have nothing to do with the LGBT community (such as the
neurodiversity pride symbol, which is a rainbow-colored infinity symbol,
but is not about gender or sexuality), which <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kansas-town-axed-librarians-confusing-162943798.html">one county
banned</a>
at a library (the Sterling library).  Another library, Andover Library,
<a href="https://www.ksn.com/news/local/andover-public-library-goes-dark-on-social-media-after-banned-book-display-leads-to-threats/">received
threats</a>
after posting information about a banned books week display on their
social media (the display included <em>Gender Queer</em>).</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Should a trans person interact with state government, they should be
expected to be treated in every way based on their sex assigned at
birth. Note that law enforcement generally has access to previous
identification issued in other states, and thus having identification
changed in another state is likely not sufficient to protect a trans
person.</p>

<p>Kentucky negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people in most situations.</p>

<p>Under a law that is currently (last checked Sept. 15, 2023) in effect (due to
actions of an appeals court in the Tennessee case) that criminalizes
hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgery,
Kentucky does criminalize trans care for children which may have an
unknown impact on child custody. These laws do not directly apply to parents.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kentucky non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some municipalities may have non-discrimination laws, such as
Lexington-Fayette County and Louisville-Jefferson County.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in schools.</li>
<li>Kentucky has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
many services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>School employees will not be able to be disciplined for using
pronouns and titles associated a trans student's sex assigned at birth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kentucky does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While Kentucky has a policy that they will not house trans prisoners
in State prisons based on "genital status alone," genital status remains a
consideration, as do many other factors (of which the trans person's
gender is at best a minor concern).</li>
<li>The State does provide some trans medical care in prisons, although
it appears this does not meet the current WPATH standard of care.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Kentucky due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>A law banning puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for
people under 18 has passed and became law. It was initially blocked
by court, but that block has been invalidated due to a decision by
the US appeals court (last checked on September 15, 2023).</li>
<li>Parents who allow children to receive trans care including puberty
blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery are not criminalized, as the
law applies only to medical providers.</li>
<li>Medical providers may be allowed to deny some care on the basis of
their religious beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some transition care (puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery)
for children is illegal. This ban shows the state's view of this care. That said,
puberty blockers and hormone therapy is currently allowed under a
preliminary injunction as noted above.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://corrections.ky.gov/About/cpp/Documents/14/CPP%2014.8%2005202020.pdf">2023 SB150 - Trans Medical Care Ban, School Bathroom Ban, Don't Say Gay</a></li>
<li><a href="https://education.ky.gov/districts/LegislativeGuidance/Documents/2023_Legislative_Guidance-Emergency_Bills.pdf">Kentucky Dept. of Education Legislative
Interpretations</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity (or really any mention) in any grade, although the
legislative guidance by the Kentucky Department of Education is
that a district that does not teach sexuality or STDs to children before
grade six can teach about sexual orientation and gender identity, due to
a possible legislative error (using "or" when the legislature likely
meant "and").</p>

<p>Kentucky has a history of interpreting religious exemptions very widely
when discrimination occurs against LGBT people.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>New Orleans has a visible LGBT population, but this is not the case in
other parts of Louisiana, including some nearby cities of New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Sexually explicit" materials in libraries (electronically or in print)
are restricted. This will likely be used to target LGBT material. Beyond
that, nearly all discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity
will be restricted in K12 schools, including in extra curricular events
if 2024 HB122 is signed by the governor.</p>

<p>Some government officials are explicitly anti-trans. For instance, on 22
April 2024, the
Superintendent of Education directed local school districts to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4613178-louisiana-education-chief-tells-schools-to-ignore-new-title-ix-rules-for-transgender-students/">ignore

<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages, and Minnesota will not
cooperate with other states who seek information about patients
receiving care in Minnesota for medical transition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Minnesota has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Minnesota</li>
<li>Minnesota will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Minnesota will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Minnesota via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
<li>Same-sex marriage is recognized by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.</li>
<li>It is unknown whether same-sex marriages are recognized in the White
Earth Indian Reservation.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Mississippi has negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people traveling to Mississippi in most situations.</p>

<p>Mississippi legally defines sex according to sex assigned at birth and
restrict bathroom and changing room usage at publicly owned or operated
educational facilities (this may include university hospitals and athletic
facilities such as stadiums). Regardless of governor signature, and
inside or outside of educational institutions, this may subject trans people
to harassment in restrooms.</p>

<p>Mississippi does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law does not have criminal penalties for parents.  However, it is unknown
how this might have an impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mississippi non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Mississippi has broad religious exemption laws that specifically
allow for targeted discrimination against trans people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Mississippi.</li>
<li>Trans and intersex people are required to use bathrooms according to
sex assigned at birth within publicly (any level of government) owned
or operated educational facility (updated May 13, 2024). This may
apply to university-run hospitals, stadiums, etc.</li>
<li>It is likely Black women, lesbian women, muscular women, and tall
women will face harassment in facilities in Mississippi, even if these women
are cis (non-trans).  These women should also use extreme caution in
Mississippi.</li>
<li>Mississippi has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Some cities/counties have non-discrimination laws, but the state's
religious freedom laws and bathroom laws will override these if the
person discriminating was covered by them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mississippi does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cruise / Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>While Mississippi has a policy at the state level specifically noting
gender identification as a component in housing decisions, the policy
lists first and foremost "inmate's physical sexual characteristics"
as a factor.</li>
<li>Trans women are typically housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men are typically housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Mississippi has a difficult process of changing gender on ID and birth
certificates, reflecting a state belief that sex assigned at birth
should typically reflect the gender of people.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not legally recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
under 18 is illegal.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
beliefs.</li>
<li>Some medical providers, such as University of Mississippi Medical
Center (UMMC) <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2023/04/26/facing-political-pressure-ummc-cut-care-to-trans-kids-before-the-legislature-banned-doing-so-emails-show/">cut off transgender care for youth before they were
required to by
law</a>.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Mississippi due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Mississippi, although
penalties will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lgbtqbar.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/sites/8/2022/12/20-16-1.pdf">MS Dept. of Corrections 20-16 - Transgender Offenders</a></li>

<li><a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/bill/SB2753/2024">2024 SB2753 - Bathroom Ban in Educational Facilities)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Any traveler should use extreme caution if they are not both cis and
have a very stereotypical gender presentation, if they use
any changing room in a government owned or controlled facility that is
open to the public, such as public parks, pools, sports facilities,
recreation centers, universities, etc.  A person may be arrested for
suspicion of violating this law and be required to produce either their
original birth certificate or amended birth certificate plus evidence of
bottom surgery, for presentation in court at a trial, if arrested.
While this is not legal advice, simply telling a police officer your sex
assigned at birth matches the facility or your usage of the exception
for trans people with updated birth certificate and bottom surgery.</p>

<p>In some cases, this may also apply to bathrooms and in facilities not
owned or controlled by the government, if law enforcement feels you
"loitered" in the wrong bathroom.  Thus Mississippi cannot be considered a safe
state for trans people, even if they feel they can meet the letter of
the law.</p>

<p>Because of the passage of several laws, and the widespread press
coverage, extreme caution should be used in all changing facilities and
bathrooms for anyone that is not unambiguously presenting following
stereotypes of their sex assigned at birth. This applies not just to
trans people, but to anyone else who does not follow gender expression
stereotypes (such as cis women with facial hair or short hair, men with
gynecomastia, etc).  Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the
political and media space, trans people should use caution, particularly
in bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks
may occur, and trans people who report these attacks can expect to be
misgendered by officials and public institutions.</p>

travelers should be particularly careful making plans for travel in
2024 or beyond.</p>

demonstrate proof of bottom surgery or a court order (updated Aug 7,

investigation</a>
(updated August 9, 2024).</p>

providing trans-related healthcare for minors, even for existing patients
who are "grandfathered" in the law. This is due to legal liability
under the new "grandfather" clause, which uses a tactic similar to
anti-abortion tactics of private action.</li>
<li>Continuation of trans youth care has been <a href="https://documents.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills241/hlrbillspdf/3009H.01I.pdf">targeted by several bills prefiled in

<p>Missouri has initiated a criminal investigation against at least
one trans woman <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/missouri-ag-investigates-ellisville-womens-gym-locker-room-use/">for using a gendered
facility</a>
(updated August 9, 2024). Thus, using bathroom or locker room
facilities, regardless of what genitals that the trans person has,
should be considered a high-risk activity which may result in the full
power of the State of Missouri against the facility user.</p>

<p>In April 2023, a trans person was <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/hate-crime-1">attacked on a city
bus</a> in St. Louis
in what may be a random attack.  The individual who attacked this person
is still at large as of March 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Kansas City's leaders have chosen to oppose the state's anti-trans
legislation and administrative orders through <a href="https://www.kcmo.gov/Home/Components/News/News/2040/1746">a sanctuary
resolution</a>
that deprioritize cooperation with the state and enforcement of state
laws that criminalize and penalize trans people.  Likewise, St. Louis's
mayor has <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/mayor/documents/executive-orders/upload/Draft-EO-Trans-Rights.pdf">issued an executive
order</a>
to resist some state policies and show support for the trans community.</p>

<p>Montana has several negative laws towards trans people.</p>

<p>Montana does not ban trans care for children (due to a court judgment
that invalidated a healthcare ban).</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Montana non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Some municipalities have local non-discrimination laws that apply to
gender identity, including Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Missoula, and Whitefish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<li>Montana has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of

<li>School students will not be able to be disciplined for using
pronouns associated a trans person's sex assigned at birth or their

</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag storytime or other "learning activities" with children present
in schools, libraries is banned, but this law is currently

<ul>
<li>Trans women would typically be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men would typically be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Montana passed a law that defined sex largely in line with sex assigned
at birth, which impacted nearly all Montana law (for example, Montana's
on-the-books-but-not-enforceable-due-to-SCOTUS anti-gay marriage law was
amended, as well as nearly every other law in Montana that references
sex).  However, the law was ruled invalid <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/06/25/montana-law-defining-sex-as-male-or-female-unconstitutional-judge-says/">due to an ambiguous
title</a>
by a state court.  Thus it is not in effect.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>A Montana law generally prevents changing of ID or birth certificate.
They have previously violated court orders on birth certificate changes.
The state is currently (as of December 17, 2024) <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4603075-montana-sued-over-refusal-to-amend-transgender-peoples-identity-documents/">being
sued</a>
for the ban on changing birth certificates and ID.  On December 17,
2024, a state court <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/12/Order-Motion-for-Preliminary-Injunction.pdf">issued a preliminary
injunction</a>
against the state blocking this law. Thus, IDs and birth certificates
can be changed, at least if Montana follows this court order (they have
refused to follow similar orders in the past).</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>While a law was passed to ban trans healthcare for youth, that law
is blocked by a preliminary injunction while further court hearings
are held. This injunction was supported by findings of the <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/12/Opinion-Published-6.pdf">Montana
Supreme
Court</a>.</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny non-emergency care on the basis of their
religious beliefs or conscious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>White supremacists and anti-trans hate groups have been known to show up
at LGBT events in Montana. For instance, on May 20, 2023, a white
supremacist transphobic hate group <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2023/05/21/bozeman-pride-marred-by-white-supremacy-anti-lgbtq-groups/">attacked attendees</a>
at Bozeman Pride.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Nebraska has some negative law and executive orders towards trans people
that affect almost all trans travelers. In particular, due to an
<a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/30/nebraska-gov-pillen-enacts-second-governor-led-womens-bill-of-rights/">executive
order</a>,
all Nebraska executive agencies will default to considering trans women
as men, and trans men as women, while non-binary people will be
considered their sex assigned at birth. This likely will apply to bathroom
and facility access of facilities under state regulation (such as airports,
rest areas, many parks) and can place trans people at significant risk.</p>

<p>Nebraska bans trans youth medical care with very narrow and limited
exceptions for continuing care.  It has an unknown impact on child
custody, although it should be noted that the law applies to medical
providers and not parents.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nebraska non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people specifically</li>
<li>Omaha has a local non-discrimination law that applies to gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>State facilities likely will fall under an executive order that
defines sex as sex assigned at birth, and will be required to enforce
that in all state regulations enacted by executive branch agencies.
This may in some cases impact private businesses, cities, schools,
and other non-state entities.</li>
<li>Trans people are not banned from using appropriate bathrooms and locker
rooms.</li>
<li>General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law
for trans people in Nebraska.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nebraska does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>Note that the executive order defining sex may make state facilities
particularly risky for trans travelers.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are required to be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men are required to be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>The State of Nebraska, via <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/30/nebraska-gov-pillen-enacts-second-governor-led-womens-bill-of-rights/">executive
order</a>,
defines trans people based on sex assigned at birth.  This is
wide-ranging and includes all executive branch agencies.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>Trans medical care is <a href="https://dhhs.ne.gov/Documents/181-NAC-8.pdf">restrictively regulated</a>
for people under 19 (Note that this includes
18-year-olds).  However, parents would not be criminalized (the
bill would apply to medical providers)</li>
<li>The current executive order for bathroom access conflicts with parts
of the youth healthcare regulations, in that it may be impossible for

receive hormone blockers and HRT under the regulations).</li>
<li>Therapy required for youth to obtain puberty blockers or HRT is required
to be "neutral", I.E. it must not be affirming
(or conversion therapy). This would tend to imply that a provider
using proper pronouns for a trans youth would be violating the law.
40 contact hours, with no more than 2 hours per week, is required for
access to puberty blockers or hormones.</li>

required to "out" the trans youth (including 18-year-olds).</li>
<li>Surgical procedures are banned for youth, including 18-year-olds.</li>
<li>The ACLU of Nebraska is challenging the youth healthcare ban.</li>
<li>Despite the law allowing youth previously receiving healthcare to

<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Nebraska's executive order defining men and women based on sex assigned
at birth creates an openly hostile state for trans travelers. This law
does not depend upon surgical status, genitals, government ID, birth
certificate, or any other "proof" of transition, and is wide-ranging
across all state government programs and services.</p>

<p>Nebraska has seen very widely publicized hate crimes against LGBT
people.  While these crimes may occur anywhere, and most anti-LGBT hate
crimes, even of the severity of the notorious crimes committed in NE,
are not publicized when they occur (and, again, can and do occur nearly
everywhere in the USA), this may be a concern to some travelers.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions. As one example, a trans man chose to
use the women's bathroom in an Omaha bar, and announced that he was
"biologically female," yet <a href="https://www.wowt.com/2024/06/08/transgender-man-speaks-alleged-assault-omaha-bar/">was attacked by another
man</a>
in April, 2024.</p>

<p>New Hampshire does not have laws that target trans people directly and has
non-discrimination laws that protect trans people.  However, if HB396 is
signed, this may significantly impact trans travelers by removing
protections for trans people and requiring discrimination against trans
people in several cases, including bathrooms.</p>

<p>New Hampshire criminalizes some surgical trans care for children, but does
not generally criminalize other gender-related care, thus it appears that
parents visiting with trans children will not risk custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>New Hampshire non-discrimination law includes trans people specifically.
If HB396's veto is overridden, however, that would change, and trans people
would be explicitly excluded for some protections, including bathroom
access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are comfortable
in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.  Legal
documentation of your gender is not required for this protection.
However, if HB396's veto is overridden, these protections would be eliminated
and certain facilities would be restricted on the basis of
transphobic definitions of sex.</li>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized for some purposes in New Hampshire, such as

some instances are recognized as non-binary.  Some recognition may
require identification documentation changes, and some organizations or

against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While New Jersey will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults and children.</li>
<li>Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
under 18 is illegal.  There is an exception for continuation of care
for people under care prior to August 1, 2023, but this exception
allows civil action still, so care is likely to be discontinued for all
youth.</li>
<li>The trans youth medical care ban is being <a href="https://lambdalegal.org/newsroom/voe_nc_20231011_transgender-north-carolinians-medical-providers-sue-to-block-medical-care-ban/">challenged in

<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, although
it is not legal to provide so it may have impacts on child custody.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade four in schools.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>In Waynesville, NC, a trans woman using the recreation center had <a href="https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/36046-a-rush-to-judgement-the-mere-existence-of-trans-people-is-not-a-crime">false
allegations spread about
her</a>
by local religious leaders and others who claimed she was exposing
herself to children (evidence has shown this could not have happened).
Fortunately police responded to these complaints rightly noting that the
woman was not violating any laws (or doing anything at all improper).  Violent
threats were also made in Brevard in July 2023 against a drag show.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>North Dakota has several negative laws towards trans people. Among these
is a legal definition of sex that may be used to restrict the rights of
trans people visiting North Dakota.</p>

<p>Government employees are entitled to misgender trans people under the law.</p>

<p>North Dakota does criminalizes trans care for children which may have an
impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>North Dakota non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people.</li>
<li>North Dakota's definition of sex law (HB1474) makes it unlikely that
non-discrimination laws specifying "sex" would be interpreted in a
trans-inclusive way. Note that this also places gender non-conforming cis
women at risk of invasive questioning and state action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when visiting public educational dormitories.</li>
<li>Trans students are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using school bathrooms.</li>
<li>Use of single-occupancy bathrooms by trans students (as an exception) in
schools requires parental permission in writing.</li>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms associated with their sex
assigned at birth when visiting jails, prisons, youth correctional
centers, etc.</li>
<li>Government employees (including school) cannot be be disciplined for
misgendering others.</li>
<li>Students in schools cannot be disciplined for misgendering others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Exposure of prosthetic genitals, breasts, or buttocks, partial or
completely, during "performance" (does not need to be paid) is
illegal. I.E. seeing the top part (above nipples) of prosthetic
breasts may be criminal. These do not need to be attached to a human
to be illegal (I.E. Truck Nutz may be illegal now). This applies in
public and in any space where minors may be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<li>Trans women would typically be housed with men</li>
<li>Trans men would typically be housed with women</li>
<li>Nonbinary people would typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Intersex people have some limited recognition.</p>

<p>North Dakota specifies male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Note that this also places gender non-conforming cis women at risk of
invasive questioning and state action.</p>

<p>North Dakota prohibits trans people changing birth certificates.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under
18, with some exceptions for people currently receiving care prior to
the enactment of HB 1254 (2023) -- but only for those procedures they
were receiving prior to enactment.</li>
<li>It is a criminal act in North Dakota to supply HRT or puberty
blocking medication to most trans minors, which may have implications
for people traveling with trans children on puberty blockers or HRT.</li>
<li>The trans youth medical care ban is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-gender-affirming-care-transgender-7d060639419ec27629003819c226ab04">being challenged in
court</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery is considered illegal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>While the laws in ND impact trans people negatively, there is some signs
of resistance.  For instance the <a href="https://www.valleynewslive.com/2023/05/10/fargo-public-schools-superintendent-speaks-out-recent-lgbtq-related-legislation/">Fargo School Board has indicated they
will ignore a law that requires outing students to their
(potentially non-supportive) parents</a>.</p>

<p>Anti-LGBT opposition has occurred around LGBT events. For instance, an
anti-trans hate group is opposing a Fargo salon doing a <a href="https://www.wdayradionow.com/news/local-news/70621-gays-against-groomers-leader-speaks-out-against-fargo-salon-hosting">trans inclusive

<p>Ohio does not have laws that target most trans visitors directly,
although a trans woman was charged (and found not guilty) for changing
in a locker room.</p>

<p>HB68 bans transition care for youth and go beyond most other bans of care
including placing significant restrictions upon mental health care,
puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery. It also protects parents
harming youth through denial of trans-related care.</p>

<p>In addition, Ohio also bans access to bathroom and locker room facilities
at all schools and universities (including university facilities such as
stadiums) except in accordance with sex assigned at birth. This would also
apply to private colleges.</p>

<p>In addition, an opinion from the Ohio Attorney General interprets
existing law to allow discrimination against trans people in bathrooms
and similar facilities, particularly if owned by government.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<li>General public accommodation access is not specifically protected by law

birth.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized for most purposes, although they
can obtain birth certificates with an "X" marker (but not driver's

Information</a>.</p>

<p>Oklahoma has negative laws towards trans people. Some of these laws may
place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>Oklahoma's executive branch considers sex and gender to be synonyms of
sex assigned at birth. This applies to government facilities and
processes, such as restrooms managed by the state government.</p>

<p>Oklahoma does criminalize trans care for children, but does not penalize
parents (the law applies to medical providers).  However, it is unknown
how this might have an impact on child custody.</p>

<p>Note that some indigenous nations within the boundaries of Oklahoma may
ban same-sex marriage recognition for people receiving services from
these nations (but this does not generally apply to non-native
visitors).</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Oklahoma state executive branch government is required to treat trans
women as men, trans men as women, and non-binary people on the basis
of their sex assigned at birth.  Note this also places gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</li>
<li>Oklahoma non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people.</li>
<li>State officials have directed schools to <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2024/04/25/four-states-to-ignore-new-title-ix-rules-protecting-trans-students/">ignore Title IX
regulations</a>
(as of April 25, 2024) regarding non-discrimination against trans people.</li>
<li>Norman, OK has a non-discrimination law locally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms/showers associated with their
sex assigned at birth when using some bathrooms/showers in both
schools and locations under the authority of the executive branch of
state government.  Note that this also places gender non-conforming
cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state action.</li>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Oklahoma.</li>
<li>Oklahoma has religious freedom laws that allow denial of some services
on the basis of gender identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Oklahoma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women will be housed with men due to executive order.</li>
<li>Trans men will be housed with women due to executive order.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people will typically be housed according to sex
assigned at birth due to executive order.</li>
<li>Medical care (HRT) has been discontinued for at least one prisoner
due to prison staff believing she was "faking" being transgender.</li>
<li>Medical care other than HRT is not generally provided (by policy).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized.</p>

<p>Under executive order, all executive branch government departments must
consider a person's gender and sex to be the same as their sex assigned
at birth. This applies to "single sex facilities" under executive branch
control, such as bathrooms.  Note that this also places gender
non-conforming cis women at risk of invasive questioning and state
action.</p>

<p>Trans people cannot change their identification or birth certificate in
Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Oklahoma, although parents
are not penalized by the law (it applies to medical providers).</li>
<li>Medical providers can deny some care on the basis of their religious
beliefs.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Oklahoma due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for youth in Oklahoma, although parents
are not penalized by the law (it applies to medical providers).</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized,
outside of some indigenous nations.</li>
<li>The Cherokee Nation and Chickasaw Nations recognize same-sex
marriage.</li>
<li>Some indigenous nations (Muscogee/Creek Nation, Choctaw Nation,
and Seminole Nation) within the boundaries of Oklahoma have banned
recognition of same-sex marriage, although this only applies to
people receiving services from these nations (I.E. most visitors
are not impacted by these bans). It is unknown how the "sex" of
trans people would be seen under these laws, potentially placing some
trans/cis marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as some queer
marriages.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The executive order that defines sex/gender on the basis of sex assigned
at birth. This places trans people at risk when using state facilities
and interacting with state government.</p>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation in
schools (and requires students be taught that avoiding gay sex will
prevent HIV).</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Tennessee has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>Tennessee (as of July 1, 2023) bans trans care for children which has
an unknown impact on child custody, however parents are not penalized
under this law (it applies to healthcare providers), except possibly if
one parent provides hormones or puberty blockers without the other
parent's consent. While a preliminary injunction (as of July 8,
2023) would have allowed both puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth
until the case challenging the ban is heard, the appeals court decided
that stay was invalid. However, the plaintiffs in a related case in
Kentucky have asked that the entire appeals court re-hear the Kentucky
appeal, which could have impact in Tennessee.</p>

<p>In addition, Tennessee
criminalizes any adults (with exceptions for parents or people
parents have given permission to) providing information, aid, or other
help to get trans-related medical treatment, regardless of where the
treatment is given or whether or not the treatment is legal in the place
it is given.</p>

and care provided via telehealth.  While a preliminary injunction (as
of July 8, 2023) would have allowed both puberty blockers and hormone
therapy for trans youth until the case challenging the ban is heard, the
appeals court decided that <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/pdf/2023/07/08/l._w._v._jonathan_skrmetti.pdf">stay was
invalid</a>.
However, the plaintiffs in a related case in Kentucky have asked that the
entire appeals court re-hear the Kentucky appeal, which could have impact
in Tennessee.</li>
<li>There are some very limited exceptions to the care ban for youth
continuing the same care who had received that care prior to the
ban up until March 31, 2024.</li>
<li>Medical providers (including mental health providers) can deny some
care on the basis of their religious or ethical beliefs.</li>
<li>Some Medical records of patients receiving care at Vanderbilt, including
private and extremely sensitive information, have been
<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2023/06/20/vanderbilt-university-m-turns-over-transgender-patient-medical-records-to-tennessee-attorney-general/70338356007/">given to the state Attorney General</a>
to investigate trans healthcare provisions.  Vanderbilt patients <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2023/07/25/patients-sue-vumc-releasing-records-related-ags-transgender-clinic-probe/">are suing
the medical
center</a>
for disclosing their private information. It is unknown if similar
records requests and disclosures have been done at other organizations.</li>
<li>In addition, Tennessee criminalizes any adults (with exceptions for
parents or people parents have given permission to) providing information,
aid, or other help to get trans-related medical treatment, regardless of
where the treatment is given or whether or not the treatment is legal in
the place it is given.  See <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2782&amp;ga=113">SB2782 with
amendments</a></li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
Tennessee due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal
protections on the basis of sex when obtaining medical care in this
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is illegal for most youth in Tennessee.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
<li>However, officials can refuse to participate (I.E. issue a marriage
license) in gay, interracial, interfaith, or any other marriage, so
people who may have a marriage some may not approve of may want to
reconsider being married in Tennessee.</li>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation or
gender identity through grade twelve in schools without explicit
"opt-in" by parents.</p>

<p>Knoxville's Pride Center has been targeted by a hate group which <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/crime/hate-message-found-at-knox-pride-on-trans-awareness-week/51-d624fe11-3507-4813-bbf5-892f7a2e36f9">hung a
threatening banner on the
building</a>.</p>

<p>Blount County may be particularly risky, as of August 31, 2023, as the
local prosecutor in the county has shown <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/tennessee-prosecutor-threatens-pride">willingness to enforce the drag
ban</a>
against a pride event despite the law being ruled unconstitutional at
the time (the law is again in-force as of July 18, 2024).</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

Information</a>.</p>

<p>Texas has negative laws and executive orders towards trans people. Some of
these laws could place trans visitors at risk.</p>

<p>It is important for parents of trans kids to research the current state
positions towards trans healthcare before a trans child visits Texas.
Texas does criminalize trans care for children through law, executive order
and legal opinion by the state's attorney general.
Elected officials in both the executive and legislative branch consider
transition of children to be child abuse. The state has shown willingness to
investigate families solely on the basis of a child's gender transition
care.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Texas non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>Cities are substantially banned from passing non-discrimination laws
due to a new law passed in 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
Texas.</li>
<li>Texas has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
some services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>An Odessa, Texas, ordinance
bans trans people from using any bathroom or changing room in the city
other than one that matches their sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Some cities, such as <a href="https://www.ktsm.com/news/city-council-oks-2-resolutions-to-promote-transgender-rights/">El
Paso</a>
are attempting to preserve trans rights to access city facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Texas does not have a drag/cross-dressing law.</li>
<li>A law that has vague language that attempted to ban "sexually oriented
performances" where a child might be able to view it and could have been
used against drag performers. This law was being <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/en/cases/woodlands-pride-inc-et-al-v-angela-colmenero-et-al">challenged in
court</a>
and is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300/gov.uscourts.txsd.1928300.94.0.pdf">ruled
unconstitutional</a>.
Thus, drag remains legal in Texas.  However, a state university's
drag ban was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677/gov.uscourts.txnd.374677.59.0.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">allowed to
stand by a local judge</a>
as the judge saw no right to perform drag. So while people cannot
prosecute drag performers or venues, at least some organizations will be
able to declare that the first amendment does not include drag and thus 
ban drag in their facilities.</li>
<li>Texas politicians, including the governor, in 2024 has repeated
stated that transgender people should not have employment in jobs
that involve interacting with children, unless they dress/present as
their sex assigned at birth. This is not legally binding, but
indicates government sentiment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are typically housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are typically housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at birth.</li>
<li>Texas considers "genital status" a key factor in housing decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Texas does not recognize non-binary gender.</p>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>It is generally impossible to change your birth certificate or ID in
Texas (information accurate as of September 4, 2024).</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>Medical transition for people under age 18 is subject to child abuse
investigations under executive orders, which are being challenged
with some success. Under attorney general opinion, medical transition
of youth is consider abuse.  However, these investigations are temporarily
blocked by a temporary injunction.</li>
<li>Texas bans puberty blockers, HRT, and surgery for trans youth with few
exceptions. This bill's enforcement actions are targeted primarily towards
healthcare providers. While this <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/texas-families-and-medical-providers-sue-texas-to-block-dangerous-transgender-youth-medical-care-ban">was challenged in a
lawsuit</a>.
While a state district court granted an injunction against the ban,
on August 25, 2023, the state immediately appealed this decision to the
state supreme court, which <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/08/25/texas-transgender-kids-health-care-lawsuit/">blocks the
injunction</a>.
Thus, this law is in effect (at least on Sept. 26, 2023), which means
that trans youth are unable to access this medical care.</li>
<li>Austin has passed a <a href="https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=427444">sanctuary
resolution</a>
which limits city cooperation with state officials in enforcing
gender affirming care restrictions. However, gender affirming care
for minors remains illegal in all of Texas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans youth medical care is illegal in Texas.</li>
<li>An executive order instructs child services agencies to investigate
transgender children in many circumstances, placing custody at risk.
However, these investigations are temporarily blocked by a temporary
injunction.</li>
<li>The executive order and legal opinion of the AG is being challenged
in court.</li>
<li>The anti-trans healthcare law penalizes healthcare providers, but not
parents (but it co-exists with the executive order and legal opinion of
the Attorney General).</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
<li>The current (2024) Attorney General of Texas requests lists of trans
people from in- and out- of state hospitals, as well as
<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/retaliation-texas-ag-paxton-demands">trans-/lgbt-related
organizations</a>.
Persons with trans children should use caution when visiting Texas
for any possible custody implications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.</li>
<li>Note that the State's "Romeo and Juliet" law which provides exception
to some statutory rape laws where a minor is involved (if the partner is
within 3 years of age of the minor) does not apply to same-sex
partners. It's unknown how Texas will determine gender, although in
past cases regarding marriage, Texas jurisdictions have arrived at
different conclusions for trans people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The state has a law that prevents instruction on sexual orientation
in schools.</p>

<p>The State has shown a willingness to investigate parents of transgender
kids, including subjecting them to different processes than are applied
for child abuse investigation (such as providing less of a paper trail).
People with transgender children should research the current status of
these laws in detail before traveling to Texas.</p>

<p>Cis women who do not look stereotypically female in a citizen's eyes
(regardless of actual appearance) have been <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/self-appointed-bathroom-cop-catches-dallas-woman-using-womens-restroom-8259104">harassed</a>
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/pdio76/dragged_out_of_bathroom/">kicked out</a>
of bathrooms by police or citizens.  In most cases, this is done with men
(police, citizens, etc) entering the women's bathroom, demanding ID, and
regardless of offered ID then kicking the woman out. In particular,
all women's bathroom users, trans or cis, who are sometimes read as men
(or do not present stereotypically femininely) should use caution.</p>

<p>Attacks against trans people occur in Texas.  For instance, a teen
riding a city bus on Houston was <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/transgender-teen-stabbed-houston-metro/285-9c3eaa18-4782-4a9e-a04a-4ca7e831afbe">robbed and
attacked</a>
in December of 2024.</p>

<p>The current (2024) Attorney General of Texas requests lists of trans
people from in- and out- of state hospitals, as well as
<a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/retaliation-texas-ag-paxton-demands">trans-/lgbt-related
organizations</a>.
The Attorney General has made it clear that trans people are an official
problem in the eyes of the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>This page contains regional-specific information that is in addition to
the information at <a href="#file-82">General United States
Information</a>.</p>

<p>Utah has some negative laws towards trans people. However,
these laws are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans travelers in most situations.</p>

<p>Utah legally defines sex according to sex assigned at birth, restricts
bathroom and changing room usage, and may subject trans
people to harassment in restrooms.</p>

<p>Utah does ban trans care for children which has an unknown impact on
child custody, however parents are not penalized under this law (it
applies to healthcare providers).</p>

<p>Note that indigenous nations may have laws differing from Utah's
and may lack some protections.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people in public
accommodations (it does include LGBT people in employment and
housing).</li>
<li>Under law, the government is required to discriminate against
trans people, both by defining sex by sex assigned at birth and
restricting toilet and changing room usage by trans people in
government owned or controlled facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Utah has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of
many services on the basis of gender identity.</li>
<li>Under law (HB257), the government is required to discriminate against
against trans people, both by defining sex by sex assigned at birth
and restricting changing room usage by trans people in government
owned or controlled facilities.  Trans people would be required to
use changing rooms in publicly owned or controlled facilities in
accordance with sex assigned at birth unless they update their birth
certificate's gender marker to a new binary marker AND have had
unambiguous binary bottom surgery in line with stereotypes for the
new gender marker.</li>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms according to sex assigned
at birth within K12 schools.</li>
<li>Trans people who have BOTH updated their birth certificate and had
bottom surgery to conform with binary stereotypes may then use either
bathroom or changing room in publicly owned facilities.  This is
because a person can use a changing room in line with their sex
(defined as sex assigned at birth) OR the other binary sex if their
birth certificate and post-surgical genitals match the other binary
sex.  That said, indecent exposure law might then apply if genitals
that don't match the sign on the door were exposed.</li>
<li>Trans people who have had bottom surgery but not changed their birth
certificate are banned from using either changing room in government
owned/controlled facilities on the basis of indecent exposure law.</li>
<li>Intersex people may use the appropriate facility, although intersex
people who have genitals that are too male or too female for the
changing room door in publicly owned/controlled changing rooms may
not be able to use the appropriate room if their genitals may be exposed.</li>
<li>While bathroom usage outside of K12 bathrooms (for bathrooms without
shower or changing facilities) is not directly regulated in Utah's
law, several laws on indecent exposure and "loitering in a privacy
space" could apply to trans people who do not have genitals that
match the bathroom's designation AND a birth certificate that match
the bathroom's designation. In addition, if using a bathroom other
than one that matches the trans person's sex assigned at birth, these
laws would likely also apply if the person has not underwent bottom
surgery.  That is, a trans person who has not changed their genitals
or birth certificate is legally (but probably not physically) safest
in a bathroom that matches their sex assigned at birth, while one
that has changed both in a binary way should use the bathroom that
matches their genitals and document. People who do not have genitals
in accordance with their birth certificate should use extreme
caution.</li>
<li>It is likely Black women, lesbian women, muscular women, and tall
women will face harassment in facilities in Utah, even if these women
are cis (non-trans).  These women should also use extreme caution in
Utah.</li>
<li>Utah has set up a <a href="https://ut-sao-special-prod.web.app/sex_basis_complaint.html">reporting
website</a>
for bathroom and other violations of transphobic law, which encourage
attachment of pictures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in Utah</li>
<li>However, at least one city (St. George) is using an obscure city
ordinance to block permits for a drag event. This is being challenged
in court, with a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.139943/gov.uscourts.utd.139943.63.0.pdf">preliminary
injunction</a>
granted to allow drag to proceed in public spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>Note that Salt Lake City Airport is a hub for Delta.  Because of
bathroom law and the hostile anti-trans environment, travelers may want to 
avoid this airport for connections.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<p>There are transphobic TSA agents known to work at the Salt Lake City
airport. While not all TSA agents are transphobic, travelers should be
prepared for the possibility of TSA agents that refuse to touch trans
travelers for patdowns (requiring supervisor intervention) due to
transphobia.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans women are required to be housed with men.</li>
<li>Trans men are required to be housed with women.</li>
<li>Nonbinary people are required to be housed according to sex
assigned at birth.</li>
<li>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-03/letter_of_findings-utah_department_of_corrections.pdf">found the state prison system violated
the
ADA</a>
by having blanket bans on more appropriate housing, access to
commissary items, conducting pat downs by inappropriate persons,
conducting genital inspections, and other violations.  As of March
12, 2024, the State has not responded to this finding or entered into
a consent decree, so these conditions should be considered ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized in limited ways.</p>

<p>Utah laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth, gametes, and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Utah allows gender marker changes on IDs in some circumstances.  It is
unknown how law passed in 2024 may impact this.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Trans medical care (other than therapy) is not legal for people under 18.
However, parents are not criminalized (the law applies to medical
providers). While the law itself does allow for the possibility of
hormone treatment of trans youth, in theory, the provisions are
extremely restrictive and place doctors at extreme financial risk,
resulting in this making it effectively a ban as any Utah provider would be
willing to take the risk of prescribing HRT or puberty blockers to
trans youth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not specifically defined as child abuse, however
puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery are banned.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other
jurisdictions</li>
<li>Child welfare agencies are covered by a law that allows them to
refuse services for religious reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized.</li>
<li>Within the Navajo Nation, the Diné Marriage Act prohibits recognition
of same-sex marriage. It is unknown how the "sex" of trans people
would be seen under this law, potentially placing all trans/cis
marriages at risk (straight or queer) as well as most queer
marriages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://legiscan.com/UT/text/SB0016/id/2668336">2023 SB0016 - Trans Youth Healthcare Ban</a></li>

<li><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0257.html">2024 HB257 - Changing Room Ban, Definition of Sex)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Any traveler should use extreme caution if they are not both cis and
have a very stereotypical gender presentation, if they use
any changing room in a government owned or controlled facility that is
open to the public, such as public parks, pools, sports facilities,
recreation centers, universities, etc.  A person may be arrested for
suspicion of violating this law and be required to produce either their
original birth certificate or amended birth certificate plus evidence of
bottom surgery, for presentation in court at a trial, if arrested.
While this is not legal advice, simply telling a police officer your sex
assigned at birth matches the facility or your usage of the exception
for trans people with updated birth certificate and bottom surgery.</p>

<p>In some cases, this may also apply to bathrooms and in facilities not
owned or controlled by the government, if law enforcement feels you
"loitered" in the wrong bathroom.  Thus Utah cannot be considered a safe
state for trans people, even if they feel they can meet the letter of
the law.</p>

<p>Because of the passage of HB257, and the widespread press coverage, extreme
caution should be used in all changing facilities and bathrooms for anyone
that is not unambiguously presenting following stereotypes of their sex
assigned at birth. This applies not just to trans people, but to anyone
else who does not follow gender expression stereotypes (such as cis
women with facial hair or short hair, men with gynecomastia, etc).</p>

<p>Due to the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be in-complete in Vermont.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>Vermont will not cooperate with other states who seek information
about patients receiving care in Vermont for medical transition.</li>
<li>It is illegal in Vermont to threaten someone or block their entrance
to a health care facility that is providing them with gender
affirming care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>Vermont has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in Vermont </li>
<li>Vermont will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While Vermont will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many

states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in Vermont via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>However, much of Vermont is considered reasonably safe.  That said,
attacks still can and do occur in Vermont.  Some areas may be more
swayed by anti-trans political rhetoric.  Burlington, in particular, is
known to tend towards LGBT friendliness.</p>

consider safety on a case-by-case basis, and as such, there is no
guarantee a trans inmate will be housed according to their gender.</li>
<li>The state settled in October, 2023 with Disability Rights Washington.
The settlement <a href="https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/drw-reaches-agreement-with-doc-to-improve-care-for-transgender-people-with-disabilities/">requires better treatment of trans

<p>DC recognizes the gender of trans people. I.E. trans women are
considered women, trans men are men, and non-binary people, at least in
some instances are recognized as non-binary.</p>

<p>DC is a "sanctuary city" for adults and kids receiving trans medical
care.</p>

<p>However, significant parts of the USA federal government are controlled
by anti-trans politicians, and on November 20, 2024, the head of
Congress has issued a statement that trans people are to be banned from
any bathroom not aligned with their sex assigned at birth in the Capitol
Building complex (Capitol, Library of Congress, and Capitol office
buildings). It is likely that as a new administration takes over, this
ban will be extended to other Federal properties in DC.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are specifically named in DC non-discrimination laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public Accommodations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans people are required to use bathrooms aligned with their sex
assigned at birth in the US Capitol Complex (Capitol building,
Library of Congress, congressional office buildings). It is unknown
how this is/will-be enforced, or what penalties, if any, exist.</li>
<li>Otherwise, Trans people are allowed to use the facilities they are
comfortable in, including bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, etc.
Legal documentation of your gender is not required for this
protection.</li>
<li>Public accommodations/businesses with single-occupancy bathrooms are
required to sign these for all gender and allow access to all
genders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag / Performance / Cross-dressing Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drag performance and cross-dressing is legal in DC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>See the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Jails / Prisons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jails and prisons consider the gender identity of prisoners when making
housing decisions.  However, this does not guarantee a proper
placement, particularly if the prisoner is housed out-of-district.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are recognized, at least by some aspects of
government, such as in the ability to change birth certificates,
driver licenses, and data gathering. However, non-binary recognition
may still be incomplete in DC.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for all ages.</li>
<li>DC will not cooperate with other jurisdictions who seek information
about patients receiving care in DC for medical transition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition care is not defined as child abuse</li>
<li>DC has a sanctuary law for people obtaining transition-related
medical care in DC </li>
<li>DC will not extradite people for violating another state's laws
against medical transition</li>
</ul>

<p>While DC will not cooperate with other jurisdictions in many
cases, this doesn't cover all possibilities and it may be possible for
states to gather evidence of someone receiving care in DC via
other means (out-of-state medical insurance, phone records, witnesses,
etc).</p>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to sometimes be misgendered
by officials and public institutions.</p>

<p>Care should also be used when interacting with public officials or
protesting government action. On December 10, 2024, A cis man was arrested
and charged with assault after a handshake with a Republican US
Representative where he asked the representative to support trans children.
The Republican Representative claims this was an attack, which is
disputed by witnesses (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5035804-nancy-mace-handshake-dispute-arrest/">See this story in The
Hill</a>).
It is likely under full Republican control of all branches of Federal
government that previously allowed protest and advocacy activities may
result in criminal charges and/or detention.</p>

<p>However, much of DC is considered reasonably safe.  That said,
attacks still can and do occur in DC.</p>

<p>West Virginia negative laws towards trans people. However, these laws
are, thus far, fairly restricted and do not apply to most
trans people traveling to West Virginia in most situations.</p>

<p>West Virginia does criminalize trans care for children, although the current
law does not have criminal penalties for parents and has exceptions for
"severe" gender dysphoria (which require specific processes to be
followed).  It is unknown how this might have an impact on child custody.</p>

<h2>Non-discrimination Law</h2>

<ul>
<li>West Virginia non-discrimination law does not include LGBT people</li>
<li>West Virginia has broad religious exemption laws that specifically
allow for targeted discrimination against LGBT people.</li>

<li>Public accommodation access is not protected for trans people in
West Virginia.</li>
<li>West Virginia has wide-reaching religious freedom laws that allow denial of

<li>The state has shown recent willingness to prohibit some trans medical

</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Some laws specify male, female, and similar words based on sex assigned
at birth and/or chromosomes.</p>

<p>Non-binary people are not legally recognized.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults</li>
<li>Medical transition (puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries) for people
under 18 is illegal, unless the person has "severe" gender dysphoria,
which requires a specific process to document the dysphoria and
contains other limitations on the care available.</li>
<li>Federal regulations protecting trans people in were blocked in
West Virginia due to the Tennessee v Becerra preliminary injunction on
July 3, 2024. Thus trans people do not have many of the federal

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>Most trans medical care is illegal for youth in West Virginia, although
penalties will apply to doctors providing the care and not to parents.</li>
<li>It is unknown if transition might be used by the state to justify
custody removal.</li>
<li>There is no sanctuary law preventing cooperation with other

<p>Rhetoric in Spring, 2024, is particularly strong around trans athletes

<a href="https://wvpublic.org/w-va-gubernatorial-campaign-attack-ads-vilify-transgender-children/">anti-trans West Virginia Governor's race

<li>Nonbinary people are typically housed according to sex assigned at
birth.</li>
<li>Wyoming in 2009 was arguing in court for the housing of intersex people
in administrative segregation, however a judge did determine that this
was a violation of the prisoner's 14th Amendment rights.</li>
<li>All state trans prisoners are currently housed according to their sex
assigned at birth (as of Aug 9, 2023).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Definition of Sex</h2>

<p>Non-binary people are not recognized in Wyoming.</p>

<h2>Medical Care</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trans medical care is legal for adults.</li>
<li>Puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery is illegal for minors,
as of July 1, 2024.</li>
<li>Wyoming does not have a "sanctuary" law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Custody / Abuse</h2>

<ul>
<li>The state, as of July 1, 2024, will ban block most non-mental-health
care for trans youth, this does not penalize parents. However it is
unknown how this will impact custody in the eyes of Wyoming courts.</li>
<li>Wyoming does not have a sanctuary law for people obtaining
transition-related medical care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Recognition</h2>

<ul>
<li>Same-sex marriage (and thus all trans marriage) is recognized</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relevant Laws</h2>

<ul>
<li>2024 HB99 - <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2024/SF0099">Anti-trans minor health care
ban</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>Many areas of the state are extremely right-wing (such as Gillette) and
people in those locations strongly oppose trans people. Many Wyoming
residents tend to side uncritically with more extremist Republican
positions. In particular, some Gillette residents have shown willingness
to aggressively express hatred towards trans people. Jackson and Laramie
tend to be more progressive (by Wyoming standards).</p>

<p>While Laramie is considered progressive by Wyoming standards, it has
also attracted both in-state and out-of-state transphobic extremists
when University of Wyoming student groups show support for transgender
people. Transphobic speakers are invited by at least one student
organization to speak against transgender people on campus.</p>

<p>A Colorado athlete competing in an amateur (recreational) tennis competition
<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/08/04/citing-safety-concerns-transgender-tennis-player-withdraws-from-wyoming-governors-cup/">decided to not
compete</a>
during August, 2023, due to safety concerns. This was fed by her
forcible outing, media storm in Wyoming, and prominent Wyoming
politicians speaking out against her, causing the story to go
world-wide. Trans women in particular should be aware of negative
attention and potential violence should they participate in women's
activities in Wyoming.</p>

<p>Because of the rhetoric around trans people in the political and media
space, trans people should use caution, particularly in bathrooms,
locker rooms, showers, etc.  Random and targeted attacks may occur, and
trans people who report these attacks can expect to be misgendered by
officials and public institutions.</p>

</section><section id='file-81'><h1 id="toc-86">Airport Bathrooms</h1>

<p>Regulations around bathrooms will generally match those of public
accommodations in the city/state the airport is in, which doesn't
necessarily match the name the airport uses for itself.  Some US airports
may be in states you don't expect (Examples: Cincinnati's airport is in
Kentucky, while Kansas City's airport is on the Missouri side of the
border).</p>

<p>It is legal for all people to use non-gendered bathrooms.  Major
airports typically will have a non-gendered bathroom (perhaps labeled as
a family bathroom).</p>

<p>Note that a January 20, 2025 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive
order</a>'s implementation
will likely restrict bathroom access for trans travelers in the USA,
due to airports receiving federal funds. This order has not yet been
implemented in this way (and hopefully won't be, but it is a
possibility).</p>
</section><section id='file-82'><h1 id="toc-87">United States - General Information</h1>

<h2>Future Outlook</h2>

<p>The current national political leadership is known for
transphobic statements and rhetoric, and have indicated that they will
implement laws and regulations to make life more difficult for trans
people, including visitors.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive
order</a>
has been issued that intends to reverse all trans-inclusive USA
policies.</p>

<p>Future travel plans should be aware of the changing nature of the
national conversation. That said, as noted above, many of the laws
in the USA are local (I.E. most criminal laws are state laws, not
national laws), and regional information should be reviewed.  This
site has pages for all USA states and territories.</p>

<p>In addition, state governments have been tending towards worsening
restrictions for trans people. Visitors should be aware that this site
generally only notes legislation that is close to being imminently
signed.</p>

<p>Beyond this, some US corporations (Facebook, Amazon, and others) have
implemented changes, including ceasing funding for programs supporting
marginalized people (particularly people who are not white, are
immigrants, or are LGBT).  In some cases, these rollbacks include, as in
the case of Facebook, explicitly allowing harassment of LGBT people.
Conferences and events by large USA companies may be less welcoming than
in the past, and travelers should validate that policies important to
them (and may have been present at events in the past) will be present at
these events (I.E. policies that may have existed in the past but not now
for some USA corporations include availability of sanitation supplies in
non-women's bathrooms, non-gendered facilities, and ability to indicate
pronouns on conference badges and similar).  Note that some cities and
states in the USA do have positive laws that prevent harassment of LGBT
people, and some also require presence of non-gendered bathrooms.</p>

<h2>Air Travel</h2>

<p>Transgender people are sometimes the victims of groping in airports or
on aircraft.</p>

<p>For air travel security, see the <a href="#file-84">USA TSA</a> document.</p>

<h2>Mass Transit</h2>

<p>In November, 2024, violent, transphobic attacks at mass transit rail stations
have occurred.  These attacks have occurred in majority "Democrat" cities,
indicating that trans people may be at risk on these transit systems.
These attacks may be rising due to increasing anti-trans political
rhetoric.</p>

<p>Attacks in the past have occurred at stations or on trains in Boston, Denver,
Houston, Minneapolis, New York City, and San Francisco.  These attacks are
generally unprovoked and can be extremely violent.  In addition, it is
unusual for bystanders to intervene on behalf of a trans victim.</p>

<p>Some safety precautions you may consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
dangerous).</li>
<li>Minimize waiting time at train and bus stations.</li>
<li>When possible, travel with others.</li>
<li>In the case of a verbal threat or insult, consider whether it is
possible to remove yourself from the situation (for instance, get off
the train if it is possible to do so and stay separated from the
potential threat).</li>
<li>When possible, de-escalate verbal threats and avoid verbal arguments. </li>
<li>Inform others of your expected travel route.</li>
<li>Do not stand near the edge of a train platform or near the curb at a
bus stop.</li>
<li>Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
phone to others).</li>
<li>Arrange safer transportation if you will likely be under the influence
of substances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Uber / Lyft</h2>

<p>Some drivers are known to be transphobic, and you may encounter
hostility from your Uber or Lyft driver.  Some trans people have
reported being refused rides or being kicked out of the car in unsafe
locations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider renting a car if you have a license can afford to do so (and
will not be under the influence of substances that make driving
dangerous).</li>
<li>Utilize in-app safety features
(<a href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/ride/safety/rider-safety-features/">Uber</a>,
<a href="https://www.lyft.com/safety">Lyft</a>)</li>
<li>Both Lyft and Uber allow you to set preferences for quiet rides. This
may reduce the chances of being "outed" for some trans people, and
will reduce the chance of verbal arguments over politics, transgender
human rights, and other contentious topics.</li>
<li>When possible, ride with others you know.</li>
<li>Ensure others know where you are and your expected route.</li>
<li>Use de-escalation techniques if the driver becomes verbally abusive.</li>
<li>Maintain awareness of your surroundings, avoiding being too focused
on your phone (but it may be helpful to appear engrossed in your
phone to others).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Immigration / Customs Enforcement</h2>

<p>The United States takes border control extremely seriously. Some
travelers have reported encountering transphobic border and/or customs
officials at USA borders.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#file-83">USA International Visitors page</a> for more
information, including information about drug importation.</p>

<h2>Advocacy and Protests</h2>

<p>Care should also be used when interacting with public officials or
protesting government action. Government officials in the USA have taken
action against protesters for previously-legal activities.</p>

<p>For instance, in Washington DC, on December 10, 2024, A cis man was arrested
and charged with assault after a handshake with a Republican US
Representative where he asked the representative to support trans children.
The Republican Representative claims this was an attack, which is
disputed by witnesses (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5035804-nancy-mace-handshake-dispute-arrest/">See this story in The
Hill</a>).
It is likely under full Republican control of all branches of Federal
government that previously allowed protest and advocacy activities may
result in criminal charges and/or detention.</p>

<h2>General Safety</h2>

<p>The USA has intense anti-trans rhetoric. While many travelers will not
encounter any violence and only encounter friendly people, particularly
in areas typically frequented by tourism, it is important to observe
situations, avoid escalation of verbal arguments, and avoid political
(or human rights) arguments.</p>

<p>Crowds of drunk young men can become violent towards visibly trans
people. If you will be around groups which may include many drunk young
men, consider your safety situation.</p>
</section><section id='file-83'><h1 id="toc-88">United States - International Visitors</h1>

<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>This page contains information specific to international visitors to the
United States.  However, additional information that is relevant is
located in <a href="#file-82">General United States Information</a> and
in the state/territory specific pages on this site.</p>

<p>Note that the US has become officially transphobic due to an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive
order</a>
issued on January 20, 2025.</p>

<p>Crossing the border with documentation that matches US government
requirements can be stressful. However, trans people do routinely cross
the US border and many do not have any difficulty crossing the border
legally.  However, it is important that your documentation be in order
and all items you are carrying follow US regulations.</p>

<h2>Border Searches</h2>

<p>Travelers legally crossing the border into the USA, regardless of citizenship
and documentation, are subject to search at the border.  This includes
examining electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones.</p>

<p>Prosthetics, post-surgical supplies, and LGBT literature are legal to be
brought into the USA.</p>

<p>When asked questions by officials, it is generally recommended to answer
honestly.  Lying to customs or immigration can be used to bar you from
entering the US.</p>

<h2>Medication and Supplies</h2>

<p>The United States regulates many types of medications. In particular,
testosterone is a highly controlled substance.  Consult the US Customs
and Border Protection <a href="https://helpspanish.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1444?language=en_US">Traveling with
Medication</a>
page for detailed information.  US officials recommend a written
prescription or doctor's note (written in English). Medication should be
contained in the original container, should not significantly exceed the amount that
you expect to use during your stay up to 90 days (if you are staying for a significant
amount of time, there may be additional limits and you will need to
obtain refills through a US doctor and pharmacy). The doctor's note
should note the condition being treated (being under the treatment of
a doctor for being transgender is an acceptable reason to have HRT).</p>

<p>It may be a good idea to ensure the name on all
prescriptions and medication bottles matches your name.</p>

<p>If in doubt, declare it.  Penalties for illegally importing medication
can be severe.  </p>

<p>Note that some states restrict access to medications, particularly for
youth.  Consult the state page for this guide for more information,
although most states do not prohibit the possession of legally
prescribed drugs.</p>

<p>Follow airline or other regulations regarding medical supplies for
equipment such as needles.</p>

<h2>Immigration Detention</h2>

<p>Immigration detention facilities in the United States do not always
respect human rights.  Persons without documentation that is acceptable
to US Immigration may find themselves in ICE custody.</p>

<p>Immigration authorities in the United States utilize many types of
facilities for detention of immigrants. These range from outdoor holding
pens to county jails in cooperating counties to private facilities run
by for-profit corporations to government-run centers.  Conditions can
vary widely between these facilities.</p>

<p>While policies exist on transgender immigrants in ICE detention, these
policies are frequently ignored by staff.  They are also in the process
of being rescinded, due to the executive order mentioned above. Once the
executive order is implemented, trans women will always be housed with
men, trans men will always be housed with women, and non-binary people
will be housed in accordance with sex assigned at birth. Safety of trans
immigrants will not be a concern of the USA.</p>

<p>However, transgender immigrants may sometimes be held in units separate from
other immigrants.</p>

<p>Rape is common within ICE detention.</p>

<p>These facilities provide substandard care for transgender-related
healthcare and other conditions (such as HIV, cancer, etc).</p>

</section><section id='file-84'><h1 id="toc-89">United States - Air Travel and Screening</h1>

<p>Due to a January 20, 2025 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive
order</a>,
the policies below are likely to change within months of the order.
These changes may include trans people being screened according to sex
assigned at birth, including pat-downs by people who share the trans
person's sex assigned at birth.</p>

<p>The below mostly discusses the policies that exist as of now, prior to
implementation of the order.</p>

<p>When flying out of USA airports (including after connecting from
international flights), security screening is required.  This is done by
the TSA.</p>

<p>TSA recommends that tickets booked for travel out of USA airports be
booked with a gender marker that matches the gender on the person's ID
they are using for travel.  However, it is not technically required, and
not all airlines implement the "X" gender marker yet.</p>

<p>Note if you are traveling internationally, you may be required to travel
with a ticket booked with the same gender as the passport you will be
using.</p>

<p>TSA utilizes body scanning technology for travelers not selected for
pre-check (see below).  When using this technology, at most airports,
the screener will hit a pink or blue button based on the anatomy and/or
gender they think the passenger has/is.  This may or may not match
gender expression.  This adjusts the machine to expect certain anatomy.
If the pink button is pushed, a penis will likely alert the TSA (it
won't say what is wrong, but will place a colored box on a cartoon
figure of a passenger indicating what needs to be patted down by the
TSA).  If they hit a blue button, breasts will likely alert.</p>

<p>Pat downs of these sensitive areas may be aggressive and triggering. You
have the right to ask for a private space and the screener of the
desired gender, although official policies may not always be followed.</p>

<p>Behavior seen as aggressive towards the TSA may result in criminal or
civil action, and you may not be allowed through security.</p>

<h2>Gender Mismatch with ID</h2>

<p>In the USA, you should generally not have problems with a gender
expression that does not match your ID.  Note this does not apply at
international destinations.</p>

<p>This may change due to the executive order.</p>

<h2>Pre-Check</h2>

<p>If you travel frequently and have the money to enroll, you can enroll in
the "Pre-Check" (or "Global Entry" which includes pre-check) program.
This increases your chance of being selected for pre-check screening. If
your boarding pass indicates "pre-check", you can use dedicated
pre-check lanes at most airports, and typically these will require a
metal detector but not body scanner, making travel possibly less
triggering. </p>

<h2>Note about International Travel</h2>

<p>This only applies to travel from USA-airports.  If you fly
internationally, airports in other countries will have different
procedures. Pre-check is a USA program, and does not apply outside the
USA.</p>

<p>If you are entering the USA, consult the <a href="#file-83">USA international visitors</a> page.</p>
